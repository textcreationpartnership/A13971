            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So theſe follow the way of the Fathers in preaching and ſetting forth zealouſly the word of God, in maintaining the authoritie thereof; as alſo the knowledge, reading, and meditation thereof: they teach alſo the true vſe of prayer with faith, deuotion, &amp; vnderſtanding: our perfect redemption by Chriſt, and the aſſured faith that we ought to haue in him; and how that we ought to truſt in his merits, and not in our owne works; his exceeding great loue towards vs, and the great corruption of our nature without his grace. In theſe points they worſhip God aright, with good king <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and they followe the wayes of their fathers.

We may ſay of theſe truly, as our Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpel ſayd of that Scribe, <hi>Thou art not far from the kingdom of God:</hi> no more ſurely are theſe.

            <p>And here gentle Reader if peraduenture in this Treatiſe I do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſome points from the godly brethren, I muſt deſire thee to beare with me patientlie: I diſſent not with a contentious mind, but with a mind longing and ſearching for the truth; and according to my ſimple Talent deliuering it to thee and to thy iudgement. Our diſſenſions are as diuers boughes proceeding from the ſame roote of the tree: and as diuers arrowes ſhot out of the ſame quiuer, aiming at the ſame marke, ſhot againſt Babel. Thou which art endued with Gods Spirit,<note place="margin">Ierem. 50.14, Rom. 8.9. 1. Cor. 2.15.</note> and art Ieſus Chriſts, iudge charitably who comes nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the marke: condemne not any. Gods ſouldiers are commanded to ſhoote not on one ſide againſt Babel, but round about her. I vrge the faſts of Wedneſdayes, Fridayes, and of Lent, which the Fathers, and the Primitiue Church ſolemnly obſerued. Who as they were not ſuperſtitious in theſe their faſts (as the Papiſts were) ſo they were not ſo curious in the numbring of the dayes of Lent as wee are, They faſted about fortie dayes, which was called of them <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſima:</hi> and euerie weeke the fourth and ſixt day, not ſuperſtitiouſly, but religiouſly, to ſtudie the Scriptures, and to came the fleſh. The which faſts I vrge now againe in our dayes, to rouſe out of the ſleepe of ſecurity the men of our age: which eate and drinke as the men did in the dayes of <hi>Noe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 17.27.</note> of whom our Sauiour giueth vs warning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leaſt we periſh with them. I wiſh that all men would watch in their priuate prayers, and that publike prayers alſo might be early in the morning: which times of praying are both agreeing with the Scripture, and to the Primitiue Church. I commend the ſigne of the Croſſe as an holy ſigne, which diuers godly learned men haue thought to be that ſigne of the Sonne of man, which ſhall appeare before the day of iudgement, whereof mention is made in the 24. of Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpell. If that ſword of <hi>Goliah</hi> that killed him, were kept reuerently lapt vp in a cloath, and that in no obſcure place, but behind the Ephod in the Tabernacle: Why ſhould not that ſword which killed the true <hi>Goliah</hi> indeed (which vaunted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt all Iſrael (I meane the Croſſe) with which ſword the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell had thought to haue killed our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">1.

<pb facs="tcp:25632:5"/> Chriſts Church amongſt vs Chriſtians? And here we may note alſo, that the Ephod may ſignifie Chriſt, as the ſignification of the name it ſelfe may ſeeme to import, which ſignifies to put on aboue, or to couer ouer all. And all Chriſtians muſt put on this Ephod aboue all their other garments of their good works, be they neuer ſo perfect: And in this reſpect alſo they may bee called Kings and Prieſts. Then <hi>Goliah</hi> his ſword muſt not be placed before the Ephod, or lapt vp with the Ephod, but lapt vp in a cloath behind the Ephod: So the Croſſe is not to be made equall with Chriſt, as the Papiſts haue made it, but to be placed behind the Ephod lapt in a cloath, that is, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and ſacred thing to be accounted of. So that this eſtimation of the ſigne of the Croſſe (for there is a mutuall relation betweene the ſigne and the thing ſignified) makes nothing for Popery.</p>
            <p>As concerning the teſtimonies of the Scriptures, which concerne theſe points of doctrine, which are handled in this Treatiſe, in ſome places I alleage them not, becauſe I haue handled them elſe where, in the expoſition of the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iude.</hi> And I haue here allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſayings of manie of the Romiſh Writers, whom they call Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes: In tranſlating of whoſe ſayings, I proteſt I haue vſed as great faithfulneſſe as can be; and that I haue many times ſtucke ſo vnto the letter, that I haue loſt the grace of the ſenſe.

This néedes no expoſition, but is clearer then the ſunne: that by the ſcriptures, euerlaſting helps are miniſtred to the faithfull. The ſixt connexion hath <hi>Gnain, Pe, Tſadi:</hi> that is, the fountaine or the eye, of the mouth, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: agreeing with that we haue expounded in the third number. The ſeuenth connexion, which is the laſt (that there maie be alſo a ſecret meaning or myſterie in the number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25632:7"/> hath, <hi>Koph, Reſh, Shin, Tau,</hi> that is, the calling, of the head, the ſignes and the téeth.

               </p>
               <p>If this be the true meaning of the Hebrew Alphabet, by Saint <hi>Ieroms</hi> iudgement, and as it were alſo an Alphabet of Chriſtian Religion, which belongs to Chriſt &amp; his church; and that ſhe is the true church, which teacheth her children the ſame: then ſurely the church of Rome, is not the true church, which doth not teach her children this Alphabet: nay which teacheth doctrine quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to this; that the fulneſſe of Chriſtian doctrine is not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſcriptures; that lay men maie haue life without the knowledge of the ſcriptures, and that they maie doe ſuch good workes, as pleaſe God, without the knowledge of them; that they are not helpers but hinderers of their ſaluation, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fountaines of hereſies.</p>
               <p>But the ſcriptures are, by Saint <hi>Ieroms</hi> iudgement, the very beginning and firſt ſteppe to Chriſtianitie, and that in heauen we ſhall not néede them: but here we doe; and that no man can doe anie thing well, vnleſſe he know firſt what he muſt doe. And no doubt his meaning is, that he ought to haue this knowledge out of the ſcriptures, and that they are not authors of hereſies, but euerlaſting helpers to our ſaluation, and containe in them plentifully all the doctrine which is neceſſarie for the Church.</p>
               <p>Surely it appeares by this, that the Church of Rome teacheth not her children, the verie firſt ſteppe to heauen and this good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: and therefore ſhee is Antichriſts Synagogue, and the mother of perdition, by <hi>Ieroms</hi> iudgement; and that without Gods great mercie ſhée endangereth the ſaluation of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Hebrew Grammar yéeldes the meaning of euerie Hebrew letter, and alſo makes mention of Saint <hi>Ieroms</hi> expoſition here declared: but belike it pleaſed him not, he puts downe another of his owne.</p>

And therefore we are to deſire of none other but of God, whatſoeuer we hope, either to doe well, or to obtaine by our good deeds. Therefore in Saint</hi> Matthewes <hi>Goſpell the Lords prayer ſeemes to containe in it ſeuen petitions: in three whereof, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things are deſired; and in the other foure, temporall things: but yet ſuch, as are neceſſarie to the obtaining of thoſe heauenly things. For when as we ſay:</hi> Hallowed be thy name; Thy kingdome come; let thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen: <hi>All which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome haue verie conueniently vnderſtood, that we ſhall keepe them in our body and ſoule altogether world without end; and that here being but as it were begunne in vs (how greatly ſoeuer we ſhall profit in them) they are but increaſed in vs, but (that which we all hope for) being perfected, in another life wee ſhall enioy them for euer.</hi>

                  <hi>But that we ſay, <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread, and forgiue vs our trespaſſes, as we forgiue them that trespaſſe againſt vs; and lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill:</hi> who ſeeth not, but that theſe doe belong to the neceſſities of this preſent life? Therefore in that euerlaſting life, where we hope we ſhall be for euer, both the ſanctification of the name of God, and his kingdome, and his will ſhall remaine in our ſoules perfectly and euerlaſtingly. But it is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called our <hi>Daily bread,</hi> becauſe that here it is neceſſarie for vs, in as much as it is to be giuen both to our ſoules and bodies, whether it be vnderſtood, either corporally or ſpiritually, or both waies. Here alſo is that <hi>Forgiueneſſe</hi> which we deſire; where alſo is all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes: Here alſo are thoſe <hi>Temptations,</hi> which either allure or moue vs to ſinne: Here alſo is that <hi>Euill,</hi> from which wee deſire to be deliuered. But there, that is in heauen; there are none of all theſe. The Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the Lordes prayer makes mention not of ſeuen, but of fiue petitions: neither doth he for all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25632:8"/> that, diſſent from Saint <hi>Matthew:</hi> but by his breuitie, he teacheth vs how theſe ſeuen are to be vnderſtood. The name of <hi>God is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> in ſpirit: And the <hi>kingdome of God,</hi> ſhall come at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fleſh: therefore Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> ſhewing that the third petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but as it were a repetition of the two former; by omitting that, would teach vs thus much. Then he addes the other, <hi>of our daily bread and remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> and of eſchuing <hi>temptation:</hi> but that which Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> hath laſt: <hi>but deliuer vs from euil,</hi> that he hath not mentioned, that we might vnderſtand that it belonged to that other, which Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> ſpake of concerning temptation. And therefore Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, <hi>but deliuer vs:</hi> he doth not ſay, and deliuer vs: ſhewing it to be but one petition. He did not ſay that, I ſay; but this: that euery one might know, that then they are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from euill, if they were not ledde into temptation. Thus farre <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>

               <p>In this ſhort ſumme of the Lords prayer, euerie true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique maie learne theſe leſſons. Firſt to make al their prayers to God alone, if they minde to be bleſſed and not accurſed: as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> here plainly teacheth. And that this prayer containes in it ſeuen petitions, thrée wherof are for heauenly things, and foure for the things of this preſent life. And the firſt thrée by Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens</hi> iudgement, we muſt begin to learne here in this life, and that although we learne them neuer ſo well and praie for them all our life; yet we ſhall neuer perfectlie learne them as long as we liue here: they ſhall be onelie perfectlie learned in heauen. How farre then ſhall thoſe be from learning theſe leſſons, which all their liues neuer knew what they meant; which ſaid <hi>Paterno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in Latine, in a toong they vnderſtood not?</p>
               <p>We maie learne here alſo out of <hi>Auſten,</hi> that all remiſſion of ſinnes, is in this life: and therefore that there is no remiſſion of ſinnes (as the Papiſts teach now) in the life to come: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Popes pardons and purgatorie are nothing worth. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true Catholique muſt learne here out of <hi>Auſten,</hi> that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſinnes, is to be had in this life: and that after his death, to giue anie thing whereby to hope to bee relieued, is in vaine. Againe here we maie learne, to reconcile <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke;</hi> and not to thinke, that euerie thing that ſéemes contrarie at the firſt ſight, is contrarie. Theſe two Euangeliſts, though they ſéeme to diſagrée; yet they agrée moſt excellentlie, as Saint
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25632:9"/> 
                  <hi>Auſten</hi> teacheth. Thus much S. <hi>Auſten</hi> teacheth all Catholiques in this briefe ſumme of the Lords prayer.</p>
               <p>But to come more particularlie to it; and to handle euerie part thereof: theſe good leſſons brieflie and dailie euerie true Catholique maie learne out of it, being ſaid in Engliſh, which by the latine <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> they could neuer haue learned.</p>
               <p>Firſt when as they ſaie: <hi>Our Father:</hi> by theſe words they may learne, that God is now their father, and therefore loues them, and cares for them; yea and that ſo déerelie, as that in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his great loue and care, which he hath of them; our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Call no man father now vpon earth: for there is but one your father which is in heauen.</hi> All the fathers in the world, loue not their children ſo déerely, nor are ſo carefull for them, as God our heauenlie father is for euerie one, euen the meaneſt of vs that be his children; euen for poore <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And this alſo was the firſt leſſon our Sauiour taught his after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when as he appeared firſt of all others to <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> who continued wéeping at his Sepulchre, when as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were gone home againe.<note place="margin">Io. 20.15.17.</note> A ſpeciall and a comfortable leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, how all true penitent ſinners ſhall finde Chriſt, euen nowe alſo after his aſcenſion. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and tell my brethren, and ſaie vnto them: I aſcend to my father, and to your father: to my God, and to your God:</hi> Oh happie newes; the gladdeſt tydings, that euer was brought to men! And this is the fruit of Chriſts paſſion. To purchaſe this for vs, he endured all thoſe torments. This we ſhould moſt aſſuredlie beléeue, and euer haue this opinion of God; and euer carrie this in our mindes: This is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leſſon. This ſhould make vs forſake our olde <hi>Pater noſter:</hi> if we ſhould haue ſaid it all our life long, it could neuer haue taught vs thus much. This ſhould make vs feare nothing. This ſhould make vs truſt in God, in all our dangers: and to come to him boldlie and with great confidence, euen as children are woont to doe to a moſt louing father, in all our neceſſities. The forgetfulneſſe of this,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.32.</note> cauſeth vs often to begin to ſinke, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, when he ſawe a great waue of the ſea comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.<note place="margin">Mat. 14.30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondlie we maie learne by this, that if we accompt God our father, then alſo we ſhould accompt one another as brethren, and ſo deale with them, as with brethren. He is a common father
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25632:9"/> to vs all; ſo we ſhould be all, as brethren one to another: and it is greatly to be feared, that at this daie, that the lacke of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and brotherly loue amongſt our ſelues, makes God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe this his fatherlie loue and care from vs. Wilt thou not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the poore, thy brethren? and deale with them, as with bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Surely then God will not be thy father. Oh what a loſſe is this! We had better make leaſes of our lands for nothing, nay léeſe all the goods in the world, then léeſe this.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note>

And <hi>Peter</hi> addeth as a ſpurre vnto it: <hi>Let euerie man, as hee hath receiued the gift; ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold graces of God.</hi> This leſſon concernes vs that liue in the ende of the world. It ſhould ſéeme, that the holie ghoſt did foreſée, how that men in the ende of the world, ſhould forget themſelues and ſhould take too much vpon them (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie do at this daie) and therefore giues vs this leſſon: We deale here in the world now, as though we were Lords; let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we are but ſtewards of the manifold graces of God, and not Lords of them. The couetous Landlorde thinkes not ſo, who thinks he maie let his lands, as déere as he liſt. The cruell vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer thinks not ſo, who thinks he maie chooſe whether he will lend or no; vnleſſe he haue good vſurie for his loane. So likewiſe, the couetous practicioners in euerie art and profeſſion, either in law or in phyſicke, thinke not ſo; which doe not paſſe what they gaine by their brethren: to whom (as the common prouerbe is) all is fiſh that comes to the nette.

But they haue not learned this leſſon of their Sauiour, to doe their brethren good: they muſt make no accompt of their ſtates. Did he reſpect his eſtate, when as hee waſhed his Apoſtles féete? No verely.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25632:13"/> And he teacheth all his this leſſon: <hi>Verely, verely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Diſciple is not greater then his Maiſter.</hi> And he vrgeth this leſſon with a double oath: and ſhall we not marke it? ſhall we not learne it? will we be greater then our Maiſter? will we reſpect our eſtates? O proud and rebellious ſeruants! O proud and vile wormes! O wonderfull humilitie of my redéemer (ſaith one) that woulde ſo humble himſelfe, and ſtoupe downe, euen to poore fiſhers, naie euen to a traitor. If Ieſus Chriſt had reſpected his eſtate, we had all béene damned: And ſhall we reſpect ours, and to maintaine that, pinch our brethren? we are none then of Chriſts ſchollers. Let vs remember what he ſaith vnto vs: <hi>If ye know theſe things, happie are ye if ye doe them.</hi> Then accurſed are they (no doubt) which know theſe things and doe them not. Neither did he forget himſelfe when as he did this: <hi>But knowing</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn) that all things were giuen into his handes of the Father:</hi> therefore how great, how worſhipfull, how honourable ſoeuer thou art, let not this thy eſtate hinder thée, to doe thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.21.</note> We are thou rather a leather coate with thy great Grandfather <hi>Adam;</hi> and dwell in a tent with thy father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

Why doeſt thou ſuffer that the miſtreſſe ſhould become the ſeruant, and that the ſeruaunt ſhould take vpon hir the authority of the miſtreſſe? Doeſt thou not knowe, that the fleſh is a priuy enemy to the ſoule, who vnder a faire ſhew of friendſhip, is more cruelly ſet againſt thee, then the cruelleſt enimy thou haſt in the worlde? when thou cheriſheſt and makes much of her, thou ſetteſt vp an enemy againſt thy ſelfe: when thou pampers and adornes her, thou armeſt thine enemie, to cutte

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Fathers of the councell of Trent,<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 6. ca. 5.</note> concerning this weightie matter, declare their iudgment thus: <hi>The beginning of iuſtification, in thoſe that haue yeeres of diſcretion, is from God, by Ieſus Chriſt, his grace preuenting them: that is, by his calling, by which they are called, without any of their deſerts, as ſuch who by their ſinnes, were turned away from God, and are now prepared by his grace, ſtirring them vppe and helping them to conuert themſelues to their owne iuſtification, by their free aſſenting and working iointly with this grace. So that God toucheth mans heart, by the light of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, neither doth man himſelfe nothing, receiuing that inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (who might alſo haue refuſed it) nor yet could he haue mooued himſelfe, without the grace of God, to righteouſneſſe before him, of his owne free will. And therefore it is ſaid in the holy Scripture: Turne ye vnto me, and I will turne vnto you. We are here put in mind of our freedome. And when we anſwere, turne vs O Lord vnto thee, and we ſhall be turned: we confeſſe that we are preuented by the grace of God.</hi> This is the ſentence of the councell of Trent, wherein they teach, that in mans firſt calling to God, Gods grace doth but only ſtirre vp his will, as being a ſléepe, and helpe it, as being weake: And that being thus wakened and helped, and ſtrengthned; it doth fréely and willingly yéeld to this grace, and ſo helpes her owne iuſtification.</p>
                     <p>But this their aſſertion diminiſheth the grace of God, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie true Catholique muſt acknowledge that he hath receiued, and it extols too much mans corrupt nature,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.8. Epheſ. 2.1. 2. Cor. 3.5.</note> which euerie true Chriſtian muſt with the Apoſtle confeſſe to be in himſelfe. Man was not onely a ſléepe through his ſinnes, but <hi>dead in them,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth: neither was he onely weake, but <hi>vnapt, vnfit,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as the Gréeke worde ſignifies, <hi>to thinke a good thought,</hi> much leſſe to doe a good worke. There remained not in man, as in one that ſléepeth, his former ſtrength, ſo that hee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25632:20"/> néedes nothing,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.</note> but wakening, to doe his dutie; but he was now quite ſpoiled and robbed thereof, and left naked: as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, and now ſtands néede of a ſupplie of newe ſtrength to be giuen him. And therefore our Sauiour (to let paſſe all Metaphors and allegories) tels <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in plaine termes, <hi>That vnleſſe a man be borne againe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh 3.3.</note> 
                        <hi>he cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</hi> This is more then the helping of a man vp that is fallen downe; or wakening one that is a ſleepe. Man muſt be borne againe: he is ſtarke dead: he muſt haue new life put in him, if he euer will enter into the kingdome of heauen. And this muſt all Gods children confeſſe. This was the firſt leſſon concerning his ſaluation, that our Sauiour Ieſus taught <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus:</hi> and as manie as do minde to be ſaued muſt alſo learne it:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.3.</note> and this will make them <hi>poore in ſpirit,</hi> which is the firſt ſteppe to bleſſedneſſe. Nay our Sauiour there plainly teacheth, that <hi>that which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi> Whereby we maie learne what we are by our owne nature, nothing but fleſh, ſonnes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> hauing no goodneſſe left in vs: but that we maie become the ſonnes of God, we muſt be borne againe, and receiue Gods ſpirit; and by it, be now not helped (as the Councell of Trent teacheth) but quickened and made aliue againe to do good works. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> agréeing to this doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour writes:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> that <hi>by grace yee are ſaued, through faith;</hi> and <hi>that not of your ſelues,</hi> no not in parte; as the Councell here would haue it. <hi>For it is Gods gift</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle:) and dare we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Gods gifts, are not moſt free, moſt ample? Dare we our ſelues challenge anie part in them: this no doubt were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſh pride &amp; proud preſumption. Nay but that which followes, plainlie prooues the ſame: <hi>Not of workes</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) leaſt anie man ſhould bragge.</hi> In this matter of our ſaluation, God will haue all the glorie himſelfe; man maie challenge no part thereof: God will not haue him bragge, no not of a mite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: he will haue all the glorie thereof aſcribed to himſelfe alone. As all the Saints of God in the Reuelation to our inſtruction, doe alſo confeſſe:<note place="margin">Reu. 7.10.</note> 
                        <hi>And they cried with a lowd voice,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation commeth of our God, that ſitteth vpon the throne, and of the Lambe.</hi> Shall they thus alowde crie out this leſſon to vs; and ſhall we not heare them? ſhall they all with one conſent teſtifie this; and ſhall we not beléeue them? But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to make
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25632:20"/> this matter more manifeſt goeth on forward: <hi>For wee are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Ieſu to good workes, which God alſo hath long prepared before, that wee ſhould walke in them.</hi> This is an inuincible reaſon, able to ſtoppe the mouths of all bragging Phariſes: we are Gods workmanſhip againe, as wel in our Regeneration, as in our Creation; and we are new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: can he that is created, challenge any part of his ſtrength to himſelfe? Such is mans eſtate to that which is good, after his fall; and to all good workes: he is regenerate vnto them. And the ſame doctrine Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth in another place:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>If anie man be in Chriſt, he is a newe creature. Olde things are gone, and behold all things are newe.</hi> Here firſt this leſſon is generall: <hi>If any one be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> It concernes all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: they were all in the ſame caſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>we are all new creatures;</hi> we, euerie one of vs now, haue newe willes, new ſtrength; new hearts: all thinges are newe: The olde things are not onely mended and repaired (as the Papiſts teach.) Mans naturall frowardneſſe to goodnes was deſcribed to vs euen in iuſt <hi>Lotte:</hi> he was loth to go out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he protracted the time: <hi>And the men tooke him by the hand (the Lord being mercifull vnto him) and led him out.</hi> He had Gods vocation; he had Gods grace offered, preuenting him: but did he by and by (as the Councell teacheth) embrace it, and aſſent vnto it? Naie it is ſaid that the Angels conſtrained him;<note place="margin">Gen. 19.15.</note> 
                        <hi>(vim faciebant)</hi> as <hi>Arrius Montanus</hi> tranſlates it. Such fréedome of will to aſſent to Gods grace offered, was in <hi>Lotte;</hi> and doe we thinke that anie of Gods ſeruants haue had hearts better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? No verely. The like we maie reade of the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, who, although <hi>God had promiſed them the land of Canaan,</hi>

                        <hi>Turne you vnto me, and I will turne vnto you.</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken to the circumciſed Iewes, who had beene well inſtructed in the law of the Lord: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot fitlie be applied to the man vnregenerate. <hi>Rupertus</hi> a Papiſt expoundes this place of <hi>Zacharie</hi> thus:<note place="margin">Rup. in ca. 1. ver. 13.

                        <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes the father, and the Lord of hoſtes the Sonne, and the Lord of hoſts the Holy-ghoſt: <hi>Turne vnto me, and I will turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you:</hi>

This is like to that, which the Holy ghoſt ſaith by <hi>Dauid;</hi> To day if ye will heare his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation, and in the day of temptation in the Wilderneſſe, when your Fathers tempted me, proued me, and ſaw my works, &amp;c.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Rupertus.</hi> Where firſt that word of reconciliation argues regeneration, and a former loue and friendſhip; but moſt manifeſtlie the example of the Iſraelites, which he addeth out of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Theſe Iſraelites, of whome <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> here ſpeakes,<note place="margin">1.

But to the vnregenerate the councell doth not rightlie applie it, euen by <hi>Rupertus</hi> his iudgement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 10.30.</note>That <hi>man that deſcended from Ieruſalem to Iericho,</hi> may reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man regenerate, and now falling into greeuous ſinnes; or if he ſignifie <hi>Adam,</hi> falling from Gods fauour into the hands of the diuell; let vs marke what a miſerable caſe hee was in: hee had no power to helpe himſelfe, no not a tongue to aſke helpe, and being helpen vp, was neither able to ſtand, nor to goe: but was ſet vpon the good Samaritans owne beaſt, to beare him. <hi>Hee was halfe dead;</hi> the fleſh liued in him, his worſt halfe: but his ſpirit and power, to doe good, was quite dead.

And therefore the cauſe why wicked men can do no perfect or ſpirituall good worke, as long as their minds are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the ſpots of ſinne; is not becauſe they lacke free-wil, but becauſe that, that is ſo entangled with the ſnares of ſinne, and ſo kept vnder with the weight of their offences, that it can no way vnlooſe it ſelfe, nor by his owne power, any way looke vp: no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then they which are in the ſtocks, haue power to go; although they cannot goe, vnleſſe the bonds bee firſt taken away which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their moouing. VVhen as therefore the light of Gods grace ſhines into the minds of the wicked, it doth not violently thruſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes vpon them, or forceth them to embrace thoſe ornaments of their ſoules; but ſtirres vp the will, which now lies on the grounde, and being weake, helpes it vp, that now it being as it were comen to it ſelfe, by Gods helpe it may freely yeeld to the calling and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and receiue his grace, neither is there any thing then that may hinder or bind this liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is alſo the opinion of the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Collen</hi> and of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dradius,</hi> concerning this matter. But how quite contrarie to the Scriptures, is this their aſſertion? <hi>Man</hi> (ſaie they) <hi>hath free-will ſtill in him, be he neuer ſo wicked, euen to vndertake anie good worke.</hi> But this his <hi>free-will is fettered or hindered onely through ſinne; the which fetters being by Gods grace remooued, it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25632:22"/> worketh freely that which is good.</hi> So that they make mans frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will the chiefe and principall cauſe of dooing good: and the grace of God, but the ſecondarie cauſe, or <hi>(cauſa ſine qua non)</hi> as the Philoſophers doe tearme it; that is, the cauſe without the which the thing could not haue beene doone. And thus <hi>

And no doubt, of this violence and of theſe goades, which the Lord God himſelfe vſeth in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinners, it is ſaid in the Acts: that the Iewes, who were conuerted to the faith by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon,<note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note>

                     <p>But let vs a little conſider, how other Catholiques, ſomwhat ſo under then theſe, haue declared their iudgementes concerning this matter. Firſt <hi>Granatenſis</hi> writes thus:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de orat, cap. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>The neceſſitie of praying continually vnto God, doth ſpring of mans pouertie and miſerie, into the which he fell through his ſinne, and of the diuerſitie of his eſtate, wherein hee is now, and wherein hee was, when God created him: For if he had continued in that firſt eſtate, he had not needed theſe engines, nor ſo many meanes, to drawe his ſoule to God, and that he might be lifted vp to the conſideration of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. For euen as the Eagle of hir owne nature flies euer aloft, and makes her neſt in high places: ſo if man had continued in that firſt eſtate, he had euer beene occupied in the contemplation of high and heauenly things, and had had his delight and dwelling in theſe. But after that hee became alſo euen ſubiect to that curſe of the old Serpent; which was, that he ſhould go vpon his belly, and eate earth all the dayes of his life, by and by he made an exchange of heauen for earth, and became altogether earth; hee loues now earth, he eates earth, he talkes of earth, on earth he hath his treaſure laid vp, and he takes ſo deepe roote now on earth, that with no chaines or mattockes now he can be pulled from thence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:25632:23"/>
                     <p>And how great this neceſſity is of continuall praying, no man can vnderſtand, but he that knowes the great pouertie which man fell into through ſinne; which is ſo great, as with no words it can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be expreſſed. It is written, that the eyes of our firſt parents were opened,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.7.</note> and that they knew themſelues to be naked: by which words the miſerable ſpoiling and extreame nakedneſſe and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into which mankind through ſinne was throwne headlong, may eaſily be gathered. For man was robbed of all grace, of originall righteouſneſſe, and of all thoſe free gifts, which he had receiued of God. But if he hauing loſt thoſe free gifts; yet if he had remained ſafe and ſound, in the gifts of nature, it had beene a great comfort vnto him: but in theſe alſo he was ſo corrupted and weakned, that from the ſole of the foot, to the crowne of the head, there was no ſound part found in him. So that of man may truly be verified that ſaying of the Prophet: And he hath put on curſing like a garment, and it hath entred as water into his bowelles, and as Oyle into his bones. It had been enough to haue ſaid, that man had put on curſing and that he was cladde with it, from top to toe; for that had beene a great miſerie: but leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that onely his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts were accurſed; hee beeing hole and ſound within: the Propet addeth; that it entred alſo like water into his inward parts, that he might declare, that nothing in him, neither within nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, was ſafe and free from that curſe. Furthermore, becauſe water doth not pierce ſo greatly into anything, leaſt any ſhould think, that ſome thing perchance lay hid in man, which was not ſubiect to that curſe, the Prophet addeth; And as Oyle into his bones: Oyle of all liquours pierceth the moſt. The curſe therefore, as Oile, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bones, which are the more ſecret and hid parts of man. This curſe reacheth euen to the very marrow; that is, to the inward and moſt ſecret parts of the ſoule; or to that chiefe ſpirituall part thereof, which we call the mind, which is a kinne (as we ſay) to the Angelles, and was made according to the image of God, which as it is a ſpirit, naturally loues ſpiritual things, and hates thoſe thinges which are of the fleſh: But it alſo being defiled and tainted through ſinne, doeth alſo now encline to fleſhly thinges. Therefore when as in man, there are three principall parts: his bodie, his ſoule, and his ſpirite; they are all infected, weakned, and corrupted through ſinne. The curſe as a garment couereth the fleſh, with all hir ſenſes, and like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it enters into the ſoule, and into all her affections; and like Oyle,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:25632:23"/> it pierceth into the inward parts of the ſpirit, and into all her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Wherefore our vnderſtanding is blinde, our will weake, our freedome feeble, our memory corrupted, and forgetting hir creator: ſeeing man therefore is throughout corrupted, deſtroied, and as it were become fleſh; how can he keepe the law of God, which is altogether ſpirituall? We know (ſaith the Apoſtle) that the law is ſpirituall: but I am carnall, ſolde vnder ſinne. What proportion is there, betweene a ſpirituall law, and a carnall man? What fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can a beaſt haue, which is altogether fleſh, that he may liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the law, which is altogether ſpirituall? If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man through ſin, be become like vnto a beaſt, altogether now enclined to the fleſh; what fitnes can hee haue, to keepe the law, which is altogether ſpirituall, which is the law of Angels, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether heauenly? Yea, he is ſo vnapt and vnfit to keepe the lawe, that hee cannot doe any worke, or ſpeake any worde, that pleaſeth God, vnles from heauen ſpeciall grace be giuen him.</p>
                     <p>By theſe things it is manifeſt, that on the one ſide if you conſider the bodie of man, that neither in the Sea, nor in the aire, nor on the earth, you can find any creature, ſtanding in ſo great neede, as man doth, and ſubiect to ſo many miſeries and calamities, as he is; againe on the other ſide, if you reſpect his ſoule, you ſhall find hir ſo weake and miſerable, that ſhe is ſcant able to open hir mouth worthily, to call vpon the name of Ieſus. By theſe things we may ſee, where and in what ſtate man was in the beginning, created of God; and into what miſeries through ſinne he is now fallen: that his ingratitude and proude diſobedience againſt his Creator, deſerued ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. God created him in great proſperity, honour, and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and thereof hee tooke an occaſion of waxing proude; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by good right, he is left ſo miſerable, naked, and voide of all goodnes, that through his pouerty, he might become humble, and through his neede diligent, and that the remedy of this need (which is prayer) might the more delight him.</p>
                     <p>Thus farre <hi>Granatenſis.</hi> In which words, he ſaieth ſomwhat more then <hi>Andradius</hi> and the councell of Trent: that man is not onelie as it were aſléepe through ſinne, but that euen the curſe of God is entred into his bones; and that it hath like Oile, euen pierced quite thorough him. If this be true, then man néedes a new Oile to be giuen him, before he can doe anie good: and this curſe muſt be taken out of his bones, and out of his marrow and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25632:24"/> ſinewes, before he be able to doe anie worke that pleaſeth God. Nay he is vnapt and vnfit now to that which is good (ſaith <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis</hi>) he muſt not onely haue his yron fetters taken from him, as <hi>Andradius</hi> affirmeth: but that he maie go ſtraight forward, he muſt haue new féete giuen him, his olde féete will not ſerue the turne: and the refore the Samaritan ſet the wounded man vpon his owne beaſt; for his owne legs would not beare him. He is become a beaſt, and therefore he néedes not only looſing from the cribbe to doe God ſeruice (as <hi>Andradius</hi> ſeemes to affirme:) but there muſt alſo a change and a Metamorphoſis bee made; hee muſt now of a beaſt be made a man: for our God will not bee ſerued with beaſts, but with men. And ſuch a feeble fréedome, <hi>Granatenſis</hi> giues to man, to make him humble; they which teach contrarie, doe make him proud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>And a little after he writes thus: <hi>Tell me what remedie can be giuen to man in ſuch a miſerable plight?

Thou wilt ſaie vnto me, that ſuch a man hath no other ſhift to make, but to begge, and from doore to doore, to aske almes for Gods ſake. The ſame onely remedie is now left for man, after he hath ſinned. He ſtands now in as much neede: And therefore now, hee hath no other comfort; but that he begge and crie, at the gate of Gods mercie, humbly acknowledging his pouertie, and asking almes, and ſaying with the Prophet, I am poore and needie, but the Lord careth for me.</hi>

                     <p>Let vs marke here, how that he affirmes, that man hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abilitie, nor knowledge left him, to do good: but that all his ſuccour muſt be like a poore begger, to call for grace to God.

                     <p>And after writing of this concupiſcence, which ſtill raignes in mans heart, as long as he liues in this world, he ſaith thus: <hi>That thou maieſt better vnderſtand this, conſider the ſingular and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:25632:25"/> prouidence of nature, in maintaining the heart: for when as the heart of all other members, is moſt hotte (for ſo it behooued it to be, ſeeing it warmes all the other members) leaſt it ſhould be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through his ouermuch heate, nature hath giuen it a continuall flappe, or thing to coole and refreſh it, that is to ſay, the lounges; which continually like a paire of bellowes, receiues ayre and ſendes it out againe, and ſo mildely cooling the heate, defends the heart, from the force of it. I haue not as yet hitherto in my iudgment, found anie example, that doth more euidently declare, how neceſſarie the refreſhing of prayer is to our ſoule: for who can deny that we haue in the boſome of our hearts, a moſt vehement heate, conſuming all things, which is concupiſcence, which the diuines call the verie tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and nouriſher of ſinne? And what els doth this heate daie and night, but that it ſets on fire, burnes, and conſumes with his flame, what good thinges ſoeuer is in our ſoules? Therefore if this cooler were not added to it, which might temper the heate thereof, with the breath of the holy ghoſt, and the dewe of deuotion, what would be the end of that hotte burning feuer? Surely it would conſume and weaken all the ſtrength of the ſoule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concupiſcence by his iudgement, is not onely the nurſe of ſinne, but ſinne it ſelfe, and as it were, a moſt raging and hotte burning agewe, that conſumes all goodneſſe in vs. And this fire is in euerie Chriſtian as long as they liue here in this world, and therefore they haue néede daily to vſe the remedie of deuotion and prayer, to coole the heate thereof; leaſt it get the victorie ouer them. This is <hi>Granatenſis</hi> his opinion, whatſoeuer other diuines thinke.</p>
                     <p>Againe, he writes thus: <hi>When as our heart is the beginning of all our workes: as our hart is; ſo are all our works, that come of it. If it be deuout and well diſpoſed, all our works which proceede from it, ſhall be alſo well ordered &amp; framed: but if it ſhall be out of frame and not deuout, all our workes alſo that proceede from it, ſhall bee out of order and without deuotion. Therefore as a Gardiner hath a ſpeciall care, that his ground be mellow, moiſt, and well dreſſed, that it may bring foorth fruit; for it is of his own nature, colde &amp; drie, (which diſpoſition will verie hardly be brought to frame) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not fit to bring forth fruit, vnleſſe it be helped by the benefit of water: So the ſeruant of God muſt giue all his diligence eſpecially, that his heart be voide from that diſpoſition, which it hath by the

                     </p>
                     <p>We maie note here, how he likens the heart of man vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate to the earth, which of his owne nature is colde and drie, vnapt altogether to bring forth anie fruits: Euen ſo is the heart of man of his owne nature now being corrupted through ſinne, vnfit to bring forth any thing that is good.</p>

                     <p>And after, the ſame author writes thus: <hi>Will you vnderſtand in few words, how neceſſarie it is for a man now being perfect, euer to ſtand in the ſight of God, and to haue his eies faſtned vpon him: (for this is it, which we call continuing in praier) let him conſider the proportion and the neceſſity, which the moone hath with the ſunne, whoſe preſence is euer neceſſarie to her: for this example will ſhewe what we meane verie excellently. Thou ſhalt finde therefore firſt that the moone hath no light nor brightneſſe of her ſelfe: but ſhee borrowes and takes that of the ſunne: ſo alſo our ſoule hath no light, no brightnes, no vertue, no grace, no fitneſſe of deſeruing any thing of her ſelfe; but what good thing ſoeuer ſhe hath, ſhe receiues it from the ſunne of righteouſneſſe Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>What can be ſaid more plainly, or truely, then this? that one ſoule of it ſelfe hath no light, no cleareneſſe, no power, no fitneſſe of deſeruing any thing. And where is then mans fréewill?</p>

                     <p>Againe the ſame writes thus of mans naturall corruption,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25632:26"/> and of the great benefit of his iuſtification. <hi>This our nature,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Mem. cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>by originall ſinne, is depriued of that ſtate and naturall ſtraightneſſe, wherein God created it. For God created it right and ſtraight, and lift vp to him thorough loue: but ſinne bowed it, and enclined it to her ſelfe; that is, to the loue of theſe viſible things, which ſhe loues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue God, and makes more accompt of, then of God himſelfe. For euen as a man which is borne from his mothers wombe, crooked or hutchbacked, can find no medicine, nor any thing in the worlde, whereby hee may recouer his naturall ſtraightnes: euen ſo whenas our will is borne thus naturally, as it were hutchbacked and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, no man is able to bring it againe to this ſtraightnes, and ſo to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it to God, that it ſhould loue God aboue all thinges, but God which created it. Therefore as we cannot obtaine this loue, which ſurpaſſeth all thinges, without God: ſo hee cannot alſo aboue all things bee ſory for his ſinnes, without the ſpeciall gift and helpe of the ſame God: for the one of theſe depends of the other. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thereof did not our Sauiour without cauſe ſay, No man comes to me, vnles my father draw him. To come to Chriſt is nothing elſe but to loue Chriſt aboue all things, and to hate ſin aboue all things. Such loue and ſuch ſorrow for his ſinnes, no man can haue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as is required; vnles God giue it him. When as God therefore deales ſo with a ſinner, it is the greateſt fauour and greateſt good thing in the world, that he can doe vnto him. For how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the gift of glory aboue the gift of grace; ſo it is a farre greater thing, to draw man out of ſinne, and to place him in grace, then he now being in grace, to beſtow glory vpon him. For there is far greater diſtance betweene ſinne and grace; then betweene grace and glorye. And therefore <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> diſputing of the works of God, ſaith: That it is a farre greater worke to iuſtifie a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then to create the world. For the creation of the whole world, is ſuch a worke as hath his limits, and hath an end, as all other things created haue: but the iuſtification of man, is as it were the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diuinitie and glorie of God, which is an infinit thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Papiſts opinion of free-will being true, the iuſtification of man is not ſuch a great work as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> here makes it. But as the world had no power of it ſelfe to create it ſelfe, no more hath man to his regeneration. His regeneration is more by <hi>Aquinas</hi> his iudgement, then the creation of the world: Oh that this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were engrafted in euery Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it would make

                        <hi>Ferus</hi> alſo in this matter agreeth with <hi>Granatenſis: The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weake: as though he ſhould ſay, I know that you haue a willing mind, but the weaknes of the fleſh hinders your willingnes. The ſpirit would doe that which it ought, but the fleſh is backward and ſlowe: it delightes in nothing, but in thoſe which ſeeme profitable for it: it will neuer watch nor pray willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it is afraid of aduerſitie; it flyeth from the Croſſe; it is offended at it; it denyeth it: to conclude, it doth nothing that is good. But contrariwiſe, the ſpirit is bold and valiant, it watcheth, it prayeth, it endures aduerſity, it makes confeſſion of the faith boldly. For the ſpirit, as often as it is compared with the fleſh, ſignifieth the nature of man, with the beſt motions thereof, without the helpe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt. Therefore the ſpirit is willing, and deſires willingly thoſe things that belongs vnto it, and moues vs to all goodneſſe: But the fleſh is weake, becauſe it euer takes not vpon it the yoke of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to that; That good which I woulde doe, that I doe not; and the euill which I would not doe, that I doe. And againe, the fleſh fighteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, that you cannot doe that which you would. What, ſhall I vſe manie words? To that which is good, though we haue a willing ſpirit, yet the infirmitie of the fleſh hinders it, and ouercomes it: but to that which is euill, though we haue but a ſluggiſh ſpirit, yet the fleſh ſtirs it vp, and pricketh it forward. Hence it is, that Iudas and the Iewes ſleepe not, but are moſt vigilant and watchfull, becauſe they make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25632:27"/> haſte to that which is wicked: But the Apoſtles ſleepe, becauſe they are admoniſhed to doe that which is good. Therefore it remaines, that as much as we truſt of the zeale on our mind, ſo much we ought to be affraid of the infirmitie of the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> here plainlie teacheth, that the fleſh euer, euen in her beſt motions, reſiſteth Gods ſpirit: and therefore what part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward can mans frée will challenge at Gods hands?</p>
                     <p>And after, <hi>we are all like <hi>Peter,</hi> before Gods iudgement come, when as yet we doe not know our owne frailtie and weakeneſſe; we are woont to be proud of our ſtrength, and as it ſhould ſeeme, to be verie feruent in the zeale of God: but when Gods iudgement beginnes to draw neere, we faint and melt away, as waxe doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire; and as the duſt that the winde driueth from the face of the earth. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore is a figure of thoſe, that will go about to doe any thing without the grace of God. To whom that euer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that both they make Chriſt a lyer, and alſo that they neuer bring to paſſe that which they go about. They make Chriſt a lyer, who ſaid, Without me you can doe nothing. And they themſelues doe not ſtand to their word and reſolution: For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I doe not the good which I would, but the euill that I would not, that I doe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And a little after: <hi>Heere alſo we ſee how that man is able to doe nothing. For euen as yron, although it be harde of it owne nature; yet is ſoone battered of ſtones, vnleſſe it be hardned in ſome liquor: So the minde of man, although it bragge that for the loue of truth, it will deſpiſe all dangers; yet it is ouercome when perils aſſault it, vnleſſe it be ſtrengthned with the holy ghoſt.</hi>

                        <hi>that there were ſeauen great wonders done in the death of Chriſt, which alſo as yet, meete alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in the iuſtification of euerie one. The Sunne was darkened at noone day, the vaile was rent, the earth quaked or mooued, the rockes were clouen, the graues opened, the dead roſe vp, and the Gentiles confeſſed. Theſe ſeauen things I ſay are done nowe alſo, and ought to be done in euerie ſinner. Firſt it is neceſſarie that all worldly things doe vaniſh away, doe diſpleaſe him and be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of his ſight. And this is that a great darkeneſſe be made,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25632:28"/> when as the things of this world muſt neither haue colour nor light in his eies. Secondly, his inward and hidden things muſt be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that is, he muſt ſee his ſinnes and acknowledge his owne filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And that is the vaile to be rent, vnder which ſuch things were hidden, that they appeared not to be vncleane. Thirdly, he muſt quake for feare at the viewe of the filthineſſe of his ſinnes, and of his conſcience, and that is, the earth to quake: for no man feares nor is troubled in conſcience, vnleſſe he ſee his ſinne and the grieuouſneſſe of it. Fourthly, the cleauing of the rockes followes, and that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of heart, and a hatred and miſliking of ſinne; and he which before was a rocke now is rent in ſunder, and ſo the rocke yeeldes waters of weeping and teares. Fiftly, the graues are opened, when as the mouth is opened by confeſſion, &amp; makes manifeſt that which was hidde. Sixtly, ſhe muſt go out by abſolution and come into the citie of Ieruſalem, that is, into the holy Church and be reconciled to her againe by a ſpirituall life. Laſtly, ſhe muſt confeſſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie both in word and worke that Chriſt is the ſonne of God, as did alſo the Centurion.</hi> Here truely <hi>Ferus</hi> declares what mans hart is before regeneration: It is a rocke, there is no ſoftneſſe, nor aptneſſe to goodneſſe in it, before grace.

                        <hi>Ferus</hi> alſo on this matter, writes verie excellently vpon theſe wordes: <hi>O Lorde, what wilt thou haue me to doe? This is the ſpeech of a changed heart. See here what Gods correction can doe, what grace can doe, what the ſpirit can doe? In one word, it makes a wolfe a ſheepe. For by and by he cries, what wilt thou haue mee doe O Lord? For I am now readie hereafter to obey thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. I would to God we were made all ſo ready by the Lords correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Surely then it would fare better with vs. For God ſtrikes vs, that he might by &amp; by heale vs: and if we be not healed, that comes of our own wickednes &amp; frowardnes. Therfore we muſt praie thus, that he will conuert vs alſo: Conuert vs (O God) of our ſaluation, &amp;c. Thou ſeeſt that this beginning of true repentance doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of none other cauſe, but from God, when as he doth touch our heart with the feeling of ſinne, and doth alſo ſo vnderproppe it, that it deſpaire not: as we heare here, that he did to <hi>Paul.</hi> For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo terrified, had runne from Gods preſence, and had vtterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, vnleſſe by Gods ſpirit, he had been called backe againe, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25632:28"/> he might crie: O Lord, what wilt thou haue me doe? Thou ſeeſt therefore, how true repentance differs from that which is falſe and counterfeit. For vnleſſe all the hart be kindled with this earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that it ſay. O Lord, I couet to forſake mine owne euill waie, and to doe that which thou wouldſt haue me doe, it is but hypocriſie, it is no repentance. But this earneſt deſire no man can frame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, vnleſſe God touch his heart. Therfore the beginning, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the end; is of God, and is Gods worke.</hi>

                     <p>Here we may learne what we were before grace, we were wolues, we were no ſhéepe: and therefore not a helping vppe or pricking forward was neceſſarie for vs; but, as our Sauiour teacheth, a regeneration. And this is that which God himſelfe promiſeth by the Prophet <hi>Ezechiell:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezech. 11.19.</note> 
                        <hi>I will take away their ſtonie heart, and I will giue them a heart of fleſh:</hi> God had néede ſhewe his moſt mightie power, as well in mans regeneration, as in his creation. His heart was become a ſtone: and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to mooue and apply it ſelfe to the grace of God, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts teach. What fitneſſe is there in a ſtone to receiue into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie moiſture, or to mooue it ſelfe vpward: and ſuch like were all mens hearts to grace, before regeneration; as God himſelfe here plainlie teacheth by his Prophet <hi>Ezechiell.</hi> And hereof alſo is that, which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in the Goſpell to the proud and bragging Iewes of their carnall deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi>

                        <hi>That God was able of ſtones to raiſe vp children to <hi>Abraham:</hi>

                     <p>This alſo that viſion, that God ſhewed <hi>Peter,</hi>

And this is that which <hi>Ferus</hi> here teacheth, men muſt become of wolues ſhéepe, before they can be acceptable ſacrifices vnto God. The beginning of the deſire which they haue to ſerue God, and the middle and continuance thereof, when as they haue once begun, and the ende alſo thereof, is of God: Not the beginning onely, as the Papiſts doe teach.

                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>And to this effect the ſame <hi>Ferus</hi> writes thus againe: <hi>Marke here that God is not onely the beginning, but alſo the perfection of all goodneſſe in vs. For he that begins; the ſame alſo finiſheth.

And men being now acquainted with theſe ſhadowes, and being deluded with theſe Images of things; do with tooth and naile, purſue after falſe good things, and being effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the falſe ſweetnes of pleaſure, are ſo kept in bondage, that they are now enemies to all thoſe, which woulde ridde them out of thoſe bonds, &amp; would endeuour to bring them to heauen, that they might behold the true ſunne indeed, and the true light, and true men, and true good things; that is, that they might behold heauenly and diuine thinges, and that they might haue the vvhole force of their minds fixed in euerlaſting things.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Oſorius.</hi>

To himſelfe glorie and exaltation, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: for which cauſe God hath exalted him, &amp;c. He hath deſerued alſo to men a generall ſatisfaction, for their ſinnes. For by his bloud, hee hath waſhed away the faults, and by his death, hath reſtored the grace of iuſtification. You are iuſtified freely (ſaith the Apoſtle) by his grace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>by the redemption which is in Chriſt Ieſus. But by this his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25632:36"/> merit, he hath ſo freely waſhed away the faults, that according to the faith of the Church, and of the holy ſcripture, he hath left ſome part of the puniſhment vnredeemed, which is either here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, with the workes of mercie, or els to be paied hereafter. And therefore thirdly he deſerued; that he which of himſelfe hath deſerued it, through ſpeciall faith and deuotion, might forgiue this puniſhment himſelfe, which we doe not doubt, the theefe did on the croſſe.</hi> This is <hi>Poligranes</hi> his opinion.</p>
                     <p>But here firſt, howe contrarie is he in this his doctrine, to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which he alleadgeth? <hi>If we be iuſtified freely by the grace of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and for his ſake <hi>by the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in him;</hi> then we are not iuſtified for our owne ſakes. No part of this redemption, remaines in our ſelues. And what is it els to be iuſtified, but a condemned man to be acquited; not onely from his crime he hath committed, but alſo from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to that crime? For herein conſiſteth the chiefe part of iuſtification, to be deliuered and diſcharged from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or els he will make our iuſtification with God, like the pardons of ſome kings, when as the malefactors be hanged, and the pardons about their necks. But the pardon which our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and louing Sauiour hath obtained for vs, is moſt frée, is moſt ample: it containes in it no ſuch exceptions of anie part of the puniſhment, of vs after to be redéemed. This worke of redemption, man muſt let that alone for euer, either in part or in whole; either for himſelfe, or for his brother: As the Pſalmiſt teacheth all men, <hi>high and low, rich and poore, one with another.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.1.2.7.8</note> And he yéeldes them alſo the reaſon: <hi>So precious is that redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſoules,</hi> that it requires ſuch a great price, as all the goods, and riches, and lands in the world, giuen or beſtowed, will not ſerue the turne. And to this place of the Pſalme, alludes no doubt Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſiluer and gold, from your vaine conuerſation, receiued by the traditions of your fathers: but with the precious bloud of Chriſt, as of a lambe vndefiled and without ſpot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This point of doctrine all Chriſtians muſt know: that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, that is the ranſome of their ſoules, and not any worke of man whatſoeuer; as this Papiſt teacheth: no not all their goods, and lands giuen to the poore can challenge
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25632:37"/> anie part herein. This requires a greater price: <hi>So precious is the redemption of ſoules,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly they muſt know, that the traditions of their fathers will not be a ſufficient warrant for them before God; vpon which thing at this daie, manie ſimple Catholiques ground their faith and religion. To deliuer vs from that vaine conuerſation, which we had learned from our fathers, Chriſt died: And ſhall wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our fathers ſteps ſtill? Shall their doings be a light vnto vs? God hath giuen vs another light to follow.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.105.</note> 
                        <hi>Thy word</hi> (ſaith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) <hi>is a Lanterne to my feete, and a light vnto my pathes.</hi> I would to God all true Catholiques would learne theſe two leſſons out of Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> And heere what neede we anie ſuch ſupplies? <hi>Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe hath ſuffered for vs;</hi> as ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo telles vs; and that not ſparinglie, but abundantlie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note>And the ſame Author goeth forward in this matter thus, vpon that place of ſaint <hi>Paul: Now I reioice for you in my ſufferings, &amp; I fulfil thoſe things in my fleſh, which are wanting of the paſſions of Chriſt, for his body which is the Church. Here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he giues vs couertly to vnderſtand, that hee ſuffers in his fleſh, to profit the Church: and that in theſe his ſufferings, that which Chriſts paſſions wanted, his did ſupply. Not that the ſufferings of Paul were more forcible then the ſufferings of Chriſt; but becauſe Chriſt by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tooke away the fault, but Paul, and other iuſt men working and ſuffering for the body of Chriſt, fulfilled that which was wanting: that is to ſay; the releaſing of the puniſhment, which was due to the fault, and the daily encreaſe of grace. And therefore theſe merites of the Saints, although they haue beene fully rewarded for them: yet becauſe they were alſo doone for others, muſt needs profit them. Wherefore by good right, they doe belong to the treaſure of the Church, to be beſtowed of any man, for ſome ſpeciall cauſe, or for the great affection of his deuotion together vvith the merites of Chriſt.</hi>

                        <hi>But this may trouble ſome perchance, that Chriſt addeth. <hi>But is all cleane:</hi> how is he all cleane, which is commanded as yet to waſh
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25632:42"/> his feete? Yea, how can he be all cleane which is baptized, when as the Scripture in euerie place affirmeth, that no man is without ſinne? It is moſt true, that no man is without ſinne: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it is alſo true, that he is all cleane, that is, purified by faith. For he becauſe he is grafted into the body of Chriſt, by faith, doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate and poſſeſſe the holineſſe and puritie of Chriſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to them that beleeue, <hi>ye are waſhed, ye are ſanctified by the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And againe, <hi>there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to thoſe that are in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore they which are grafted into Chriſt, are called holy, for the faith, name and bloud of Chriſt; although in the meane time, in themſelues they are nothing els but ſinners, and haue in them much ſinne as yet, but no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe they are accounted iuſt with God through faith in Chriſt. Hereof it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe: <hi>with my minde I ſerue the lawe of God, but with my fleſh the lawe of ſinne.</hi> Ferus</hi> here plainly teacheth, that mans righteouſneſſe is by imputation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and not by any inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>And againe, ſpeaking vpon <hi>Stephens</hi> death, he giues theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table leſſons vpon theſe words:<note place="margin">Fer. in cap. 7. Act.</note> 
                        <hi>(Lord Ieſu receiue my ſpirit.) <hi>He railes not, nor curſeth not; but with great modeſtie cals vpon God: To him alone he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mits his ſoule. Here I would haue thee alſo learn the beſt manner of dying: Firſt he is carefull not for his body, but for his ſoule: the wicked doe contrarie. Secondly, hee cals vpon God, diſtruſting in himſelfe, and of his owne merites: but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truſt in their owne merites, and therefore they builde vpon the ſande. Thirdly, he confeſſeth his faith briefly: but moſt perfectly, calling him Lorde, who is able; and Ieſus, who is alſo willing to ſaue. Theſe three things are eſpecially to be marked: for they are verie neceſſarie to a bleſſed and happy death:</hi> For they are bleſſed which die in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would to God all true Catholiques, which minde to die wel, would learne theſe thrée leſſons of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> out of <hi>Ferus:</hi> Firſt, to haue more care of their ſoules, then of their bodies. It makes no matter, what maner of death they die, or what coſt be beſtowed vpon their funerals: let them do good and beſtow their goods themſelues,<note place="margin">3. Cor. 5.20.</note> 
                        <hi>while they are in the bodie.</hi> Secondly, that at the houres of their deathes; yea and all their life long alſo, (if then in that extremitie) they would call vpon none other, but, as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:25632:42"/> Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> doth here, vpon Ieſus Chriſt. Thirdly, that they would condemne themſelues, as vnprofitable ſeruants, before the maieſtie of God, and not truſt in their owne merites: as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> here teacheth them. And here if Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> truſted not in his Martyrdome, being ſo notable a worke, neither was it laid vp in the treaſurie of the Church, to helpe the ſaluation of others; much leſſe the works of anie other: as <hi>Poligranes</hi> teacheth. And laſtly, that they would confeſſe the Lord Ieſus, euen this ſhorte faith, theſe two wordes, as Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> did.

The ſame queſtion is now alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs: whether faith or workes doe iuſtifie?

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:25632:43"/> to confeſſe that; that good workes muſt be done: but whether they iuſtifie or not? The Apoſtles conclude, that faith iuſtifieth, and not workes, nor the lawe. And why doth faith iuſtifie? becauſe it leanes vpon the grace and mercy of God, vpon the promiſes of God, vpon the merites of Chriſt. Why doth not the law iuſtifie? becauſe no man euer kept it. Why doe not workes iuſtifie? becauſe they are vnperfect: <hi>All our righteouſneſſe is like a defiled cloth.</hi>

                     <p>This is the ſumme of the Apoſtles councell, ſaith <hi>Ferus;</hi> what can be ſpoken more plainly then this? Here are queſtions propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and anſweres ſhaped to them: and the concluſion is, that faith onely iuſtifies, becauſe it relies wholie and onely of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and promiſes of God: and that works, no not of the beſt men, cannot iuſtifie, becauſe they are imperfect.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh that all they which crie out, Generall councels, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councels, and will beleeue nothing but that which generall councels doe teach, would marke diligently the concluſion of this firſt Generall and Apoſtolicall councell, in this great and waightie matter, euen in the ſaluation of their ſoules: and that they would condemne all other generall councels, which doe not agree with this both in matter and forme. They direct their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crées from that generall thus:<note place="margin">Act, 15.28.</note>

                        <hi>Yet I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the comforter will not come vnto you: but if I go away, I will ſend him vnto you.</hi> The holie Ghoſt comes here in Chriſts place, and hee is his Vicegerent; hee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Byſhops and Paſtors in the Church;<note place="margin">Act. 20.28, 13, 2, 10, 19.</note>

                        </hi> He is Preſident in this councell. And is not this to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and to be head of the Church?</p>
                     <p>And a little after, <hi>Ferus</hi> writes thus: <hi>This is the chiefeſt point of all Chriſtian Religion, vpon which all other doe depend, that <hi>in Christ Ieſus is all fulneſſe:</hi> and therefore all that are iuſtified, are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified onely by faith in him, and by nothing els. This is the ſumme of all the Goſpell, this is the matter of all Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of thoſe which he wrote to the Romaines, Galathians, and Hebrewes. And here marke the conditions of falſe Apoſtles: Firſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:25632:43"/> they bragge themſelues to be Chriſtians. <hi>They departed from vs, but they were none of vs;</hi> they are accounted in the number of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when as they are nothing leſſe; although they be baptized with water, and partakers of other myſteries, yet they are not baptized with the ſpirit, nor incorporate into Chriſt, from whome their life doth ſo greatly diſagree. Counterfeit Chriſtians haue euer done more harme to the church of Chriſt, then Infidels: no enemies more hurtfull, then falſe teachers, and eſpecially then thoſe, which teach men to truſt in their workes. For theſe reach vs a broken ſtaffe and daube vp the wall without morter: theſe Chriſt bids vs beware of, ſaying: <hi>Beware of falſe teachers.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Ferus</hi> declares his iudgement plainly concerning our iuſtification: That we are iuſtified <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nica fide in Ieſu Chriſto) <hi>by onely faith in Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
                        </hi> and that this is the chiefeſt point of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: and that this doctrine Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught almoſt in euerie of his Epiſtles: and that they which teach men to truſt in workes, are falſe teachers. If this be the chiefeſt point of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion (as it is indéede) then in the chiefeſt point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion <hi>Ferus</hi> is on our ſide. And as <hi>Baſill</hi> writes of the Philoſophers:<note place="margin">Baſ. ho. 8. in. car.</note> 
                        <hi>The wiſe men of Greece</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue diſputed much of the natures of all things: but there is no reaſon, there is no firme or ſet opinion among them: the latter opinion euer ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, ſo that we may eaſily ouerthrowe their opinions, when as they by their mutual diſtenſion, are ſufficient to ouerthrow themſelues:</hi> ſo I maie ſaie of the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if they be falſe teachers, which teach men ts truſt in their workes, by <hi>Ferus</hi> his iudgement, then are the Papiſts falſe teachers. Againe, of Chriſtian righteouſneſſe <hi>Ferus</hi> writes thus: <hi>He ſpeakes not only of that righteouſnes which giues euery man his owne (ſpeaking of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> making his Oration before <hi>Foelix</hi> and <hi>Druſilla</hi>) but of Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, which is faith in Chriſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In cap. Act. 24.</note> Onely faith in Chriſt by <hi>Ferus</hi> his iudgement, is Chriſtian righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. The workes of the Phariſées were, no doubt, as painfull as are nowe the workes of the Papiſts:<note place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note> 
                        <hi>They faſted twiſe in the weeke they prayed, they payed their tithes truely, they were no extortioners,</hi> they offered no man violence or wrong: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaide to <hi>haue beene brought vp in the Citie of Ieruſalem at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>

Let all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians learne to bee wiſe, by their examples, that they alſo looſe not the workes which they haue wrought. God cannot abide this mind in anie of his ſeruants, that they ſhould goe about to <hi>iustifie themſelues in his ſight:</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Oſorius</hi> alſo contrarie to the aſſertion of <hi>Poligranes,</hi> of Chriſts merites and redemption, writes thus: <hi>He was ſo deſpiſed that we accounted him not a man:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Sapie. lib. 1</note> 
                        <hi>but he bare our infirmities, and ſuſtained our ſorrowes. <hi>But we ſuppoſed that he had beene ſtricken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of God for his owne ſinnes. But he through his wounds did beare the puniſhment of our rebellion, and was afflicted for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. For this he tooke vpon him, that he might eſtabliſh by his puniſhments, the nouriture and diſcipline of our peace; by which he was to make vs perfect friends with God, and that hee might heale our wounds by his ſtripes. For we al haue gone aſtray like ſheep, &amp; euery man turned his owne way: but the Lord appointed vnto him the puniſhments due to our ſinnes. Theſe and many other things, the Prophet Eſay proſecutes, by which he declareth the intollerable ſorrowes of Chriſt, and his moſt bitter and vnſpeakable torments.</hi>
                        </hi> Thus farre <hi>Oſorius.</hi> In which words he teacheth that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, not onelie for the faults; but alſo for the puniſhments due to our ſinnes: And that by his ſufferinges wee are made perfect friends with God.</p>

                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Sapi.</note> of the merite of Chriſts redemption the ſame <hi>Oſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> verie excellentlie writes thus: <hi>Gods iuſtice required that there ſhould be a iuſt recompence made of the law of God, tranſgreſſed by man through his ſins. There was nothing of ſuch force on earth, that was able to make this ſatiſfaction. But without a iuſt ſatiſfaction for the offence, the equity of Gods iuſtice did not ſuffer, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind which had offended the Maieſty of God, and was now ſpotted with all manner of ſinne, ſhould bee receiued into Gods fauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: therefore it was meet, that mans nature being ioined to the nature of God, ſhould be ſo rich, that it ſhould aboundantly make ſatiſfaction to God the father for the ſinne of all mankind. Therefore Chriſt borrowed this of his diuinitie, that his body being holy, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and ſtained with no ſpot of ſinne, ſhould haue in it infinite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and force, whereby it might pay all the debt we were bound in. And hereof he ſaith, <hi>I paid them the things I neuer tooke.</hi>

For we doe not proſtrate our prayers before thy face tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in our owne righteouſneſſe, (as the Prophet ſaith) but in the multitude of thy mercies and in the merites of thy ſonne our Lorde.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25632:51"/> that were loſt: by him thou haſt created man to thine owne image and likeneſſe; and by him thou haſt reformed man againe to the ſame image.

                        <hi>It is a greater miracle, that God ſhould be taken, ſcourged and condemned, and die vpon a Croſſe; then to receiue an enemie for a friend, and to vſe a traitour as a ſonne, if he would repent him, and be conuerted vnto the Lord. If therefore that be done which is the greater, why ſhould we doubt then of that, which is the leſſer? Now therefore (O Lord) thy mercie is extold and lift vp verie high, and thy bounteous liberality is proued and tried vpon ſinners; thy iuſtice alſo is magnified, it hath exerciſed and executed her rigour and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie vpon the innocent and harmeleſſe without fault: wherefore, although grace be not giuen to a ſinner, to him as he is a ſinner; yet notwithſtanding let it be giuen him, for thy deerely beloued ſonnes ſake, who redeemed him with ſo deere a price, and at ſo great a rate.

                     <p>And <hi>Gagneius</hi> himſelfe, as ſhould ſéeme, miſlikes this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for in his preface vpon the Epiſtle to the Romans he writes thus: <hi>But if any man will vrge, when as verie often in this Epiſtle and alſo in other his Epiſtles,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that we are iuſtified by faith without workes; <hi>that not onely the workes of the lawe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but alſo all other things els whatſoeuer: I will not greatly ſay againſt him, if he wil patiently endure to heare, that iuſtification
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:25632:56"/> is taken in the ſcripture two waies. Firſt to be iuſtified, is of one that is wicked, to be made iuſt; the which thing is doone in a moment, and without any merites of our works, yea and without any works of ours going before it. And here marke that I ſay, going before it: for together with that iuſtification, muſt needs come the mouing of free-will repenting of her former life, and beleeuing in Ieſus, beeing of God drawne and ſtirred vp to that motion. And of this Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Paul ſpeakes, as often as he ſaith, that men are iuſtified and ſaued without works.</hi>
                        </hi> Here he ſeemes to ſaie plainelie, that our firſt iuſtification is without anie workes, that it ſaues vs: and yet after he ſaieth, that it is <hi>but a ſaluation imperfect, and begun in vs, when as a man ariſeth from infidelity and ſinne to grace, which he deſerues by no work, but yet it is not doon without a good work, and mouing of the will: which freely is powred into it of God.</hi> Here hee ſeemes to be contrarie to ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi> when as hee ſaith, that <hi>without the works of the law we are iuſtified:</hi> and he will haue euen in our firſt iuſtification one concurrent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he ſeemes to diſagree from the councell of Trent, which teacheth, that our free-will beeing ſtirred vp, agrees wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie and iointlie workes with grace: but hee ſaieth it muſt be drawne, and this argues a violence: and thinges extorted and not voluntarie,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.5.</note> haue no reward with God, as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> plainlie teacheth.</p>
                     <p>But after, hee makes a ſecond iuſtification, and to this iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication hee ſaieth; <hi>Good workes are required.</hi> And hee allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that one place for proofe hereof, out of the Reuelation: <hi>He that is iustified, let him as yet be iuſtified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But he might as well haue conſidered, how that as in that one place the holie Ghoſt exhorts all them that are iuſtified, that they bee <hi>iustified ſtill:</hi> ſo it teacheth all Chriſtians to praie for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith.<note place="margin">Roman. 1.16.</note> And againe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth; <hi>I am not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Gospell of Christ: for it is the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to all that beleeue it, to the Iewe firſt, and then to the Gentile.</hi> Here is the firſt iuſtification; but it followes: <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God is reuealed in it from faith to faith, as it is written: The iust ſhall liue by faith.</hi> And here is alſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond iuſtification, if hee will needes haue a ſecond, <hi>From faith to faith.</hi> The iuſtified man is more iuſtified, <hi>from faith to faith:</hi> as his faith increaſeth, ſo his righteouſnes: And hereof it is ſaid
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:25632:56"/> here, that the <hi>iuſt man liues by faith;</hi> not onelie the firſt moment of his iuſtification, but all his life long. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.5.</note> 
                        <hi>That through faith we are kept by the power of God, euen vnto ſaluation.</hi> Faith not onelie liftes vs vp from hell, as the papiſts teach; but it preſerues vs euen to euerlaſting life.

                        <note place="margin">Lib. ſpir. &amp; lit. cap. 9.</note> and doe wee thinke then, that hee euer thought of anie ſecond? Thus hee writes: <hi>By grace the wicked man is iuſtified freely, that is, hauing no merites of his works going before. For otherwiſe, grace were not grace; becauſe therefore it is giuen, not becauſe that we haue doon good works, but that we may do them: that is, not becauſe we haue fulfilled the law; but that we might fulfill it.

                        </hi> And this is the grace, whereof by and by he ſaieth; <hi>Being iustified freely by his grace.</hi> So that by ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> iudgment, this grace which we receiue in our firſt iuſtification, is that grace of God, which before our iuſtification all men were depriued of: And will <hi>Gagneius</hi> ſaie then, that our iuſtification is imperfect?

                        <hi>that he ſuppoſeth that a man is iuſtified by faith, without the works of the law: hee meanes not that when as wee haue receiued and profeſſed the faith, that the works of righteouſnes ſhould be deſpiſed; but that euery one may know that he may be iuſtified through faith, although no works of the law haue gone before. For they follow a man that is now iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: they do not go before him which is to be iuſtified.</hi> This is ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> plaine iudgement, that workes are fruites of our iuſtification, not rootes: they are neither precedent, nor concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſes, but effects following.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> And after hee addes the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, why ſaint <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> wrote their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and expoundes their meanings, whereas they ſeeme to make much for good workes: <hi>Becauſe this opinion</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>was then ſproong vp: (that is, that works were deſpiſed) the other apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Epiſtles of <hi>Peter, Iohn, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> againſt this opinion bend al their force; ſo that they very vehemently affirme, that faith without workes profiteth nothing. As alſo Saint Paul himſelfe cals not faith, euery faith, wherewith we beleeue in God: but that healthfull and euangelicall faith, whoſe workes proceede from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and faith (ſaieth he) which vvorketh thorow loue. Therefore he affirmes, that that faith which ſome men thinke is ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to be of ſo ſmall force, that he ſaith: <hi>If ſo be that I had all faith, ſo that I could moue mountaines out of their places, and yet had no charity, I am nothing. But where this faithfull charitie works, there is a good life, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>So that by ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> iudgement, that vaine and barren faith, which ſome men in thoſe dayes imagined of their owne braines, and deſpiſed all good workes, doe both ſaint <hi>Iames,</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:25632:58"/> ſaint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the reſt of the apoſtles condemne in their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: and not that Euangelicall and liuelie faith, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calles faith. Some men in thoſe dayes taught, that if one kept a whore openlie; and yet ſaid, that hee beleeued in Chriſt, by his faith hee ſhould bee ſaued.<note place="margin">Aug. de fide. &amp; oper. cap. 1.</note> Againſt ſuch, ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> makes that Booke, and affirmes, that ſuch a faith cannot profit anie man.</p>
                     <p>Againe here we note, howe the Fathers are to be vnderſtood, when as manie times they ſaie, that charitie couers ſins, and mercie ſaues, and ſuch like phraſes they vſe, that as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> doeth here ſaie, that faithfull charitie liues well: ſo alſo faithfull charitie couers ſinnes, and faithfull mercie ſaues.

But howe ſhall they call on him, on whom they haue not beleeued?</hi> So that prayer hath this vertue to ſaue, not of her ſelfe, but of faith. And ſo we maie (no doubt) ſaie of other good workes. Euerie thing the more excellent it is, doeth more communicate his vertue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: as euen the verie fire his heate to the colde and harde I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; ſo that now Iron burnes, but it is by reaſon of fire, that impartes his vertue vnto it; ſo likewiſe the ſunne impartes his forces to theſe inferior creatures; ſo trees impart their ſappe to their fruites: and ſhall wée thinke that faith is leſſe forcible then fire?<note place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note> and are not workes called <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſſe?</hi> and why maie not faith, which is the roote of righteouſneſſe, impart this his ſappe vnto them?</p>

But Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goeth on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and writes thus: <hi>Our aduerſaries</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>affirme, that the imputation of Chriſts righteous is neceſſarie, not only becauſe ſinne truely euer remaines in vs: but alſo becauſe our inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not ſo perfect, that it might ſimply and abſolutely iuſtifie vs. But we will eaſily refute this cauſe: if our aduerſaries will beleeue the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For our inherent righteouſneſſe, or our inward renouation, is knowne chiefely to conſiſt in faith, hope and charitie: wherefore if we ſhall proue, that faith, hope and charitie can bee perfect in this life, we ſhall alſo proue, that the imputation of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is not neceſſarie.</hi> But how contrarie alſo is this his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to the ſcriptures? <hi>We know in part</hi> (ſaith ſaint <hi>Paul) <hi>and we propheſie in part:</hi>
                        </hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.10.</note> 
                        <hi>but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part ſhall be aboliſhed.</hi> There is no perfection in this life: that ſhall come hereafter in the life to come. No doubt that prayer of the Apoſtles is ſet downe as a paterne for all Chriſtians to vſe,<note place="margin">Luke, 17.5.</note> euen vnto the worlds ende. <hi>And the Apoſtles ſaid vnto the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:25632:59"/> Lord: Increaſe our faith.</hi> How contrarie alſo he is, in this his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion to <hi>Ferus</hi> and other Papiſts, hereafter euidently ſhal, God willing, appeare.</p>
                     <p>Of the merites alſo of good workes Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writes thus: <hi>And firſt of the nature of a merit or deſeruing:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 5. de Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fica. cap. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>many thinges</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the ſunne, the moone, the fields, vineyardes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, yeelde vs great commodities; and yet they are not ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to deſerue any thing of vs; becauſe they doe not their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties voluntarily, neither can they chooſe, but they muſt doe as they doe. Then wages is due to a deſert or merit: but debt ariſeth not, but hereof; that one giues another, that which was his owne. For if he ſhould not giue his owne, but that which was another mans, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were owing or due to him. There is nothing properlie ours, but that which is in our owne power, either to doe, or to let paſſe. Theſe things are in our power: and of theſe we are properlie ſaid to haue the Lordſhip. To conclude, our euill workes, vnleſſe they be done freely, deſerue no puniſhment: therefore neither good works ſhall deſerue any reward, vnleſſe they be done voluntarily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His drift is to proue, that we haue in vs fréewill; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we maie deſerue of God. And therefore he writes thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Now truely the good workes of the iuſt deſerue eternall life <hi>(ex condigno)</hi> worthily, not onely by reaſon of the couenant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of God; but alſo by reaſon of the worke it ſelfe. So that in the good workes which proceede from grace, there is a certaine proportion and equalitie to the reward of eternall life.</hi> And after he writes thus: <hi>Whereby we perceiue that ſame degree of glorie which is due to vs by right of inheritance, is giuen vs alſo by right of the reward: For one thing (as we haue often ſaid) may bee due by two titles; that is, by inheritance, and of merites.</hi> How contrarie alſo in this doctrine is he, to the doctrine of the ſcriptures? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt ſhall ſaie to all his: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 25.34. Luke, 12.32.</note>

How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie is he alſo herein to <hi>Philippus de Dies? Who ſaith, that the iuſt can challenge nothing of God:</hi> and to <hi>Ferus,</hi> as appeares in this that followes.</p>

                     <p>But here firſt let vs marke, howe contrarie this his doctrine is to that, which <hi>Gregory</hi> a Byſhoppe of Rome, concerning this matter,<note place="margin">Greg. in 7.

But it is one thing to giue according to workes; and another, to giue for our workes: In that hee ſaieth, he will giue euery one according to his works; the quality of works is vnderſtood, that he, whoſe works ſhall appeare good, ſhall haue that glorious reward. For to that bleſſed life, wherein we ſhall liue with God, and of God, no labour can be equal, nor no works com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, eſpecially when as the Apoſtle ſaith; The ſufferings of this life are not worthy the glory, which ſhall be reuealed in vs.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaieth, that in the good works, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from grace, there is a certaine proportion and equalitie: but <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, no labour or worke can bee compared vnto it.</p>
                     <p>And after, hee writes thus: <hi>Although in this reſpect alſo it may bee called mercie, becauſe it is giuen for thoſe vvorkes, which vnleſſe Gods mercy did preuent him, no man could obtaine; wherefore it is ſaid in the Pſalme: <hi>My God his mercie hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented me.</hi> For vnleſſe he had made the Veſſelles of wrath Veſſels of mercy: his owne holy life had ſeparated none from that lumpe of perdition, his owne righteouſneſſe had deliuered none, from the puniſhment of euerlaſting death. Therefore it is certaine, that to whome he giues mercifully, that in this life they ſhould do well, he giues them more mercifully, that in that euerlaſting bleſſednes, they ſhuld a hundreth fold be rewarded. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace, which for grace, the Apoſtle affirmes, ſhall be giuen vnto the Saints of God, that to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life is giuen the grace of ſanctification, to them of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the life to come, ſhal be giuen the grace of euerlaſting hapines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here wee maie note, how <hi>Gregory</hi> makes two expoſitions of theſe wordes, <hi>God ſhall render to euery one according to his works.</hi> And in both, he takes awaie all merite: and in both he ſets downe the onelie cauſe of our reward, to be mercie. In the firſt hee ſaieth, not for our workes, as anie cauſe of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but according to our workes, as effectes, we ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Againe, not according to the quantitie of our workes,

                     <p>Secondlie, hee ſaieth, that as all our good workes were of mercie giuen vs, in euery of them, God by his grace preuenting our willes; ſo they ſhall of meere mercie be rewarded: as then wee had no merites, for which in the beginning of our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wée deſerued at Gods handes to haue thoſe good works gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs; ſo neither in the rewarding of them: nay they ſhall bee more mercifully, and of greater mercy (ſaieth <hi>Gregory</hi>) rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the laſt, then they were giuen at the firſt. Contrary to that Popiſh aſſertion, which affirmes, that our firſt iuſtification is free, and of mercie, but it is not ſo in the ſecond.

                        </hi> Alſo in another place he writes thus:<note place="margin">In cap. 3. Ioh.</note> 
                        <hi>Furthermore alſo by this word may be vnderſtood, that onely Chriſt by right and merit aſcended into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for to him by right belongs the kingdome of heauen; becauſe he is the naturall ſonne of God: And therefore he ſaith, <hi>all thine are mine:</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>The heauen of heauens are the Lordes, but the earth hath he giuen to the children of men.</hi> All others which haue aſcended, or ſhall aſcend, haue this onely of grace, by no right, but becauſe God onely hath promiſed this of his mercie: neither our works of what kinde ſoeuer they be, are ſo great, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this reward, either of right or of deſert; but in as much as God accepts them in mercie. Hereof it is that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this life, are not worthy the glorie we ſhall haue:</hi> And the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The waight of eternall glorie, aboue all meaſure ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth all the ſufferings of this life.</hi> And of theſe he collecteth: That we are ſaued by grace, and not of workes; leaſt any man ſhould glorie. And laſtly, ſo that word may be vnderſtood, that no man by his owne righteouſneſſe, may ſtand or appeare before God, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:25632:63"/> onely Ieſus Chriſt: neither any maruell: <hi>For all are gone out of the way, and are altogether become vnprofitable.</hi>

But Chriſt dare appeare before God, becauſe he is the ſonne of God, and all other being damned and quite vndone, he onely hath the fauour and grace of God; he onely poſſeſſeth righteouſneſſe: and to conclude, he onely hath in himſelfe, all the good gifts of God. Alſo onely his righteouſneſſe is acceptable to his father, becauſe it is mingled with no ſinnes: yea it is moſt pure, hauing proceedeed from the great loue and charitie of his father: That all the world may know (ſaith he) that I loue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I doe as the father hath commanded: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was obedient euen to death:</hi> Therefore he alone could deſerue for vs the opening of heauen, the loue of his father, and the holy ghoſt. By this word therefore Chriſt would humble vs, that we ſhould neuer preſume of our ſelues, nor of our owne righteouſneſſe: not that we ſhould doe no good; but that we ſhould acknowledge our ſelues <hi>vnprofitable ſeruants, although we ſhall haue done all that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs.</hi> Alſo by this word, he taught that we ſhould ſeeke all good things from him and by him: for it is a moſt true ſaying.

                        <hi>would whippe his owne ſonne? But God, that he might ſpare his enemies and them who were vnthankefull to him, gaue his ſonne to death. He hath giuen vs his righteouſneſſe, merits, yea and whatſoeuer he hath done or ſuffered. And therefore wee may glorie of them, as if they were our owne, which thing only can preſerue vs from deſperation.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> If we haue Chriſt with all his merites giuen vs, what néede we anie more, what neede we anie merites of Saintes out of the Popes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

I anſwere, he is not laide hold on (ſaith he) by the hand of the body; but by the hand of the hart, which is faith. Therefore in only Chriſt by the faith of thy heart, thou ſhalt finde ſufficiencie and aboundance, becauſe he alone brought with him God himſelfe, with all his goods. This faith in Chriſt maketh not aſhamed, becauſe Chriſt is truth. And therefore <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith: <hi>All that beleeue in him ſhall not be confounded.</hi> For faith directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, neuer confoundeth.

                     <p>And to the ſame effect, <hi>Ferus</hi> writes on the Preface of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew: Haue that euer before thine eies of <hi>Eſay: A childe is borne vnto vs,</hi> and liued for vs, and died for vs, and that which is more, <hi>is giuen vs,</hi> with all that he hath: Therefore when thou heareſt Chriſt to haue done or ſuffered anie thing, thinke that ſame Chriſt, with that he hath done or ſuffered, to be thine; inſomuch that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bragge thereof, as of thine owne: for he needed not, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated or circumciſed; he needed not to faſt, pray, or ſuffer: but hee hath giuen all theſe thinges to vs, we ſtand in neede of them: For our merites are not ſufficient. For they are like a defiled cloth of a woman. Therefore thou muſt ſay, O Father, I acknowledge that I am nothing: but I know that Chriſt hath done this, not for himſelfe; but for me, &amp;c.</hi> But ſome will ſaie then, whereunto ſerue our good workes, if Chriſts merites be ſufficient? <hi>Ferus</hi> anſwereth a little after, <hi>Haue care</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that of the truth of God, thy faith may be nouriſhed; and of his mercie, thy hope; and of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thy loue; and of his iuſtice, thy feare.

                        <hi>that the worke of incarnation, was both of mercy and of debt. But you will ſay by and by, if it were of mercy, how was it of debt? and if of debt, how of mercy?

To vs nothing is due; ſo that, all the rewardes of the Goſpell, are due by promiſe; not of merite or deſert.</p>
                     <p>And after the ſame <hi>Stella</hi> writes thus: <hi>See how ſure and firme Gods promiſes are; becauſe he fulfilles that which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, although thoſe to whome the promiſes are made, do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which they haue promiſed.

And hereof Dauid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth: <hi>That thou maieſt be iustified in thy words, and ouercome when thou iudgest.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay: performe thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not becauſe I am worthy, but that it may appeare and be made manifeſt, how true and iuſt thou art in thy promiſes.

Into this fountaine were all my ſinnes caſt, and all my iniquities were drowned in it. For thou by the merit of thy vnſpeakeable humilitie and charitie, by which thou waſt moued, that thou ſhouldeſt take all my ſinnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, diddeſt not onely deliuer me from them: but alſo madeſt me partaker of thy goods. Thou vndertookeſt my death, and thou gaueſt me thy life: thou tookeſt vpon thee my fleſh, and thou gaueſt me thy ſpirit: thou tookeſt vpon thee my ſinnes, and gaueſt me thy grace: Therefore, O my redeemer, all thy treaſures, and riches are mine. Thy purple clotheth me; thy crowne honoureth me; thy wounds make me beautifull; thy ſorrowes are my pleaſures; thy bitterneſſes refreſh me; thy ſtripes heale me; thy bloud enricheth me; and thy loue as it were makes me drunken.

                     <p>

Many take their ſoule in vaine, which do not giue it again to God, of whom they haue receiued it. Wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: <hi>Who ſhall aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hill of the Lorde, or who ſhall ſtand in his holy place?</hi> And he himſelfe makes an anſwere, <hi>which hath not receiued his ſoule in vaine.</hi> A thing is receiued in vaine, when it is not vſed to that end whereunto it was made: thou haſt made thee a garment, and thou weareſt it not; that garment is made in vaine: for a garment is made to be worne. Thou haſt bought a horſe, and thou neuer ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt on him; thou haſt bought him in vaine: for thou vſeſt him not to that end for which he was made and found out. God hath giuen thee an vnderſtanding, that thou ſhouldeſt know him, a will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou ſhouldeſt loue him, a memory where with thou ſhouldeſt remember him: but thou, becauſe thou entangleſt thy vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in diſcerning worldly matters, in gaining riches, in ſeeking for honours, in getting worldly goods, and thou imploieſt thy will in louing the fleſh, and goods of this world, and exerciſeſt thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in thinking vpon iniuries which haue been doone vnto thee, leaſt thou ſhouldeſt ſuffer them to eſcape vnpuniſhed: theſe things being well conſidered, it muſt needes follow, that thou haſt receiued theſe powers of thy mind in vaine, becauſe God hath created them not to this purpoſe, but to ſerue him.

                        <hi>Againe,</hi> Ambroſe <hi>ſpeaking of the vſe of the law, writes thus:</hi> But alſo the law yeelds me this commodity, that we are not iuſtified of the works of the law:<note place="margin">Amb. de Iacob &amp; beat. vit. ca. 6</note> therefore I haue no cauſe why I ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in my works: I haue no cauſe why I ſhould boaſt of my ſelfe: and therefore I will glory in Chriſt. I will not reioice in that I am iuſt, but I will reioice in that I am redeemed: I will not reioice that I am void of ſinne, but becauſe that my ſinnes are forgiuen mee: I wil not reioyce, becauſe I haue doon God any ſeruice, or that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath doone any thing for me, but becauſe Chriſt is become my
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25632:78"/> Aduocate with the Father, becauſe Chriſts bloud is ſhedde for me. My fault is now become to me the wages of my redemption, by the meanes thereof I obtaine Chriſt. For my ſake, Chriſt taſted death; my fault profited me more, then my innocency: my innocency made me arrogant, my fault made me humble. Here thou maiſt ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the law profited thee, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Granatenſis <hi>of workes and merites writes thus:</hi> The ſecond ſteppe to humility is, if a man know that that which he hath from God (if ſo bee that hee haue any thing) hee hath not obtained it by his owne ſtrength, but by the meere grace and mercy of God,<note place="margin">Gran. de per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. amor. dei cap. 16.</note> that he hath receiued it. There are found ſome, that beeing well grounded on the firſt ſtep, confeſſe, that all which they haue, comes from God; yet notwithſtanding they nouriſh in their breaſts a ſecret perſwaſion, that they haue gotten all that they haue to themſelues, by their owne labour and merites or deſerts, when as it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the merites themſelues, as well as that which is obtained by the merites, to be the graces of God: vvhen as we cannot haue a thought or one good deſire, that is not of God.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore alſo, our works haue not the value and merite they haue, of themſelues, but of the grace of God; by which they are doone: For euen as the value of any coine, is not of the ſubſtance of the coine, but eſpecially of the Image and inſcription that it hath; ſo the merit of our workes doeth not ſo much proceede of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the worke, as of the grace of God, which giues value to them. And therfore as often as by them any grace is giuen vnto vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen one grace is giuen for another: euen as if a friend ſhould giue thee a hundreth pieces of gold, and for them afterwards ſhould giue thee a horſe: Here were both a ſelling and a giuing; gaine and grace: Grace, becauſe thy friend gaue thee; gaine, becauſe vvith the mony that he gaue thee, thou boughteſt the horſe of him.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet doth couertly teach vs both theſe, when hee ſaith: <hi>Come and buy without money, and without any exchange, Wine and Milke.</hi> That is, meat and drinke, both for the beginners, and for thoſe that are perfect. In which words, when as he biddes vs buy, he declares our induſtry: but when as he excludes Siluer and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, he ſhewes grace. All this therefore declares, that man hath nothing in himſelfe, whereof he may glory, thinking that which he hath, comes of himſelfe; yea rather he ought to thinke that he hath of himſelfe infinite ſinnes, for which he deſerues ſo many hels: And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25632:79"/> that all things elſe whatſoeuer they are, come from aboue, from the Father of light, and are beſtowed on vs of grace, when as merite it ſelfe is grace. <hi>Thus far</hi> Granatenſis: <hi>who plainlie affirmes, that all our merites are grace. And ſurelie our wages, that the beſt of vs is to looke for (if wee bee worthie of anie) is like the wages they receiued, that came into the Vineyard at the eleuenth houre of the daie: a wages alſo of grace, and not of deſert or merit. But</hi> Granatenſis <hi>goeth forward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this, the fourth ſteppe is to be added: for it is not ſufficient that a man acknowledge himſelfe poore and deſtitute of all good things; but alſo it is neceſſary, that he acknowledge how truly hee abounds with many euilles: that is, how greatly he loues himſelfe, and his owne will, and ſtands in his owne conceit, how liuely are all his euill affections, and how perfect are all his wicked motions, how inconſtant he is in good purpoſes, how lauiſh in his tongue, howe careleſſe in keeping of his heart, what a louer he is of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and of the deſires of his owne pleaſures. To know theſe things is the beſt knowledge in the world, and alſo moſt profitable: For other <hi>knowledges</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſayeth) <hi>puffe vs vp,</hi> but this onely makes vs humble. And it is alſo true, that to the obtaining of this knowledge, our owne exerciſe onely ſufficeth not; but wee ſtand need alſo of the light of heauen, that the miſt of our owne ſelfe-loue do not blindfold vs, which is a very blind iudge. And for this cauſe euery Chriſtian ought to aske of God this light, and that as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Saint <hi>Frances</hi> did, who very often in his prayers repeated theſe words: O my God, that I may know thee, and that I may knowe me. Neither is it ſufficient for him, that he account himſelfe ſuch a poore and grieuous ſinner, but let him imagine that he is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinner in the world, and the moſt vile of al ſinners. And this is a degree higher then the former: for as a certain doctor ſaith: It ſhal hurt thee nothing, to caſt downe thy ſelfe at the feet of all men, but it may hurt thee if thou preferre thy ſelfe before any one, &amp;c. <hi>Thus</hi> Granatenſis <hi>would haue euerie Chriſtian humble himſelfe. And is not this the verie doctrine our Church teacheth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Granatenſis <hi>alſo of our ſinnes, and the ſatiſfaction of them, writes thus:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Granat. Med. in orat. dom.</note> Who can euer caſt the account of my vaine thoughts? who can number my euill works and idle words?

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25632:79"/> which I ſhould not haue doon, and in omitting of that which I ought to haue doone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And after;</hi> But doeſt thou ſo forgiue vs our ſinnes freely, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and without any recompence? Truely thou forgiueſt them freely, and not freely: not freely, for although mercy bee ready to forgiue, yet iuſtice will be ſatiſfied: and yet freely, becauſe thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt vs that freely, wherewith iuſtice is ſatiſfied; that is, that huge &amp; incomparable treaſure, which thine only begotten ſon laid vp for vs, the ſpace of three and thirty yeares; to the which he made a way to vs by his bloud. This treaſure we offer vnto thee (O Father) take thereof as much as thou wilt; it may be drawne, but it cannot bee drawne drie; it may be ſpent, but it cannot be diminiſhed. His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites are ours, his ſatiſfaction is ours, his bloud is our ranſome. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we beſeech thee (O Lord) that being pacified with the blood and merites of thy Sonne, that thou wouldeſt winke at our faults, the which if thou wilt call to a ſtrict account, no man is able to abide the fauour of thy iuſtice, much leſſe the ſeuerity of it. Therefore let thy mercy helpe vs, who acknowledge our ſelues be damned of thy iuſtice of many hainous offences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And againe in another place hee writes of the ſinnes of all men thus:</hi> That thou maieſt better marke what thinges wee haue ſaid, thou muſt diligently conſider the multitude of the ſinnes of thy life paſt, eſpecially of thoſe which thou committedſt when as thou hadſt leſſe knowledge of God: for if ſo be that thou ſhalt come to the perfect knowledge of them al, thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that they are moe in number, then the haires of thy head, and that thou haſt liued like a Pagan or Ethnike, which knew not what God was. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, runne ouer both the Tables of the tenne Commandements, and thoſe ſeauen deadly ſinnes, and thou ſhalt learne that there is no Commandement of God, which thou haſt not often broken; and no deadly ſin, into the which thou haſt not often fallen, by work, word, and thought. Remember the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> that becauſe he did eate the forbidden meate, he did commit the moſt grieuous ſinne in the world: and there is no kind of ſinne wherein thou haſt not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers waies and oftentimes offended.

Go to therfore, tel me how thou haſt paſt ouer thy childhood, how thy youth, how thy mans eſtate; and that I may ſay all in a vvord, how thou haſt liued from thy mothers wombe til this day? To what things haſt thou em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied thy appetite, and other powers of thy mind, which thou haſt receiued of God, that thou ſhouldeſt know him and ſerue him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? How haſt thou vſed thine eies? no other wiſe, then that thou mighteſt delight them in vaine things, and fond ſhewes. What haſt thou delighted in to heare with thine eares? ſurely vaine fables, filthy talke, and lies.

The ſame thing God doeth in vs before he come to our heart: firſt, hee ſends a mightie wind, ouerthrowing the mountaines; that is, he ouerthrowes all things which ſeeme great, and takes away all truſt; but yet the Lord is not preſent: for there are many which haue nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may truſt; and yet they haue not God. But this is the firſt ſteppe of his comming. Then followes the earthquake, when man vnderſtands what he is, and when he conſiders the miſery of the world; then the holy Spirite is nearer, but yet hee is not preſent.

And we beleeue, and therefore we alſo ſpeake.</hi> He would not haue ſaid the ſame, vnleſſe they had had the ſame Spirit of faith. But as they when as that Sacrament was hidden, beleeued that Chriſt ſhould be incarnate, and we beleeue that he is incarnate: his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to iudgement is looked for both of them and of vs. <hi>Thus far</hi> Ferus. <hi>Where hee teacheth plainely, that all true Catholiques muſt truſt in Chriſt, and in his merites; they muſt doe good workes, but they muſt not truſt in them; they may one pray for another, but one cannot ſaue another: they muſt let that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for euer, as</hi> Dauid <hi>teacheth in the Pſalmes.

                        <hi>And in another place hee writes thus: <hi>Vnleſſe a man be borne againe:</hi>
                        </hi> Nicodemus asked Chriſt nothing expreſſely, and yet Chriſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:25632:86"/> firſt of all anſweres him of regeneration. By this he hath taught all Preachers, that firſt they make the tree good, and then that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire good fruites, that is to ſay, that firſt they teach faith, whereby a man may be iuſtified; and afterward good workes: and in this one ſhort word, he comprehendeth the whole ſumme of Chriſtian religion. Man truly was created to euerlaſting felicity, but becauſe thorough his ſinne, he became accurſed, it came to paſſe, that not onely himſelfe, and all things that he had, but that alſo all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity became accurſed: therefore becauſe wee are borne of Adam, we are all become vnprofitable and abhominable both in body and ſoule, in all our power and hability. Vnleſſe therefore, by the grace of God we be borne againe, and of Adams Sonnes, bee made the Sonnes of God, all things are in vaine that we doe, or endeuour, or thinke, or ſpeake; yea our ſelues are vaine, and all our reaſon, will, ſtrength, and works. Therefore he that deſires to enter into the kingdome of God, muſt become a new man: ſo alſo he that deſires to ſee the kingdome of God, that is, to vnderſtand the myſteries of the kingdome of God, and his heauenly doctrine; as God ſhewed to Iacob the kingdome of God, in that ladder lift vp, which reached to heauen: he muſt lay aſide all fleſhly wiſedome, he muſt deny his owne reaſon, he muſt deſpiſe his owne ſtrength, and muſt yeelde himſelfe wholy as it were a bondſlaue to the word of God. By this word therefore Chriſt condemnes vs, and all things that wee haue, that hee might prouoke vs more forcibly to ſeeke helpe of him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, by this word, he wreſts from vs all confidence in our ſelues, or in our owne works, and takes from vs that ſtaffe of a reede; that we may learne to truſt in the onely mercy of God. For faith is the ſure ſtaffe of our old age, by which alone we may paſſe ouer this Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of temptation: the figure whereof was ſhewed before in Iacob. Here therefore learne, why God in the Scriptures, oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes our works and our endeuours: for he doth not this, to bring vs into deſpaire, or becauſe good works do not pleaſe him; but that he may teach vs, to truſt only in the mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And a little after hee writes thus:</hi> Although one man beeing compared to another, one may ſeeme more nobler or wiſer, or more iuſt then another: yet if we reſpect the power, wiſedome, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, we are all alike weake, ignorant, and ſinners; neither one, not ſo much as an haire, excels another: <hi>For we all ſtand need of the grace of God. <hi>And after,</hi>

                     <p>Ferus <hi>here plainelie teacheth, that a right faith muſt bee the roote of all good workes, and that is ſuch a faith as the Goſpell tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: that is, that Ieſus Chriſt is both able and willing to cure all diſeaſes, both of bodie and ſoule: and with ſuch a faith all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould come to him alone: and that this faith ſhould be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in euerie Chriſtians heart, which the Papiſtes haue not doone heretofore in their Church. And after this faith, then good works ſhould bee taught and required. Secondlie hee teacheth, that we haue no power to doe good left in vs: wee are not like Birdes in a Cage, which if the ſtoppe of ſinne were taken awaie, would voluntarilie flie out, as other Papiſtes teach: but euen deade Birdes and Carions, hauing no ſtrength or power at all to doe good: and that Chriſt condemnes vs, to make vs more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie to flie to him; and that wee muſt not put anie confidence or truſt in our workes: and that before God, there is not anie one man, a haire better then another; but all are alike ſinners, not excepting the bleſſed Virgine Marie of her owne nature. What doctrine can bee more agreeable to the Goſpell, then this? or to that, wee nowe teach in the Church of England? I woulde to GOD all Papiſtes woulde marke it and beléeue it.</hi>

For when as our hope, whereby we do promiſe to our ſelues eternall life, doth truſt both to our works, and alſo eſpecially to the mercy of God and his omnipotency, which doth proceed of our merites; and when as we do often looſe the grace of God by our ſinnes, and we our ſelues do hinder the courſe thereof, that it doth not flow into our hearts: it comes to paſſe truely, that our hope is ſo certain, that yet it is euer coupled and ioined with feare and doubtfulneſſe. For hee, which conſiders the goodneſſe and omnipotent power of GOD, neuer doubts, nor feares any thing; but is as the mount Sion, which of no ſide can be remooued: but when he conſiders his owne frailty and pronenes to ſinne, as long as he liues; then he feares, leaſt he ſhould expell or hinder the goodnes of God. Wherefore when as Saint Paul ſaith, that <hi>hope maketh not aſhamed,</hi> and he calles it the <hi>ſure Anchor of the ſoule;</hi> he conſidered the omnipotency and power of God, vpon which our hope chiefly reſteth: by which it hath this vertue, that it is without al doubt. But the Vniuerſity of Collen, where they ſay, that it doubteth very much, they conſider the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our nature, and the force of our deſires, which oftentimes force vs from the ſtanding in the law of God and reaſon; and doo as it were driue vs into theſe ſinnes, whereby we looſe the brightnes of righteouſneſſe, and merit the anger of God, and euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                     <p>But the vniuerſity of Collen writes thus:<note place="margin">Dialog. 4. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra. Monhem.</note> 
                        <hi>Who euer hath taught thus of faith, that the ſaluation of euery particular man ſhould bee obtained by it, or haue relation to it? For faith is of all things moſt aſſured, which neither can be deceiued, nor deceiue. But the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of euery priuate man (ſay they) is very vncertaine, much more their eternall ſaluation; how therefore can faith bee had of ſuch vncertaine things?</hi> This is the cenſure of the Vniuerſitie of Collen, whereas both Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> auouch, that they <hi>which beleeue aright, know that they haue eternall life:</hi> ſo that by the cenſure of the Vniuerſitie of Collen, wee muſt not beleeue aſſuredlie, wee muſt not knowe that wee ſhall be ſaued; wee muſt onelie hope that wee ſhall bee ſaued. And they ſaie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>That the certainty of hope is not ſuch, that any man truſting thereunto, ſhould not doubt: for ſo long as we hope (ſay they) we are vncertaine: as the very Etymologie of the name of hope doeth teach vs.</hi> Thus wée maie plainelie ſee, howe they will haue vs doubt ſtill of our ſaluation, which doubting, is both contrarie to faith, and alſo to knowledge, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>
                     <p>But to returne againe to M. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> former anſwere, his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25632:90"/> meaning is thereby, though hee diſſent from the vniuerſitie, to prooue, that no man ſhall bee aſſured, or know that hee ſhall bee ſaued. For hee ſaieth a little before, <hi>that euen by our confeſſion, faith is neceſſary to the forgiuenes of ſinnes. But</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>out of what word of God do they learne, that they haue ſuch a faith, as is required to get and obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes?</hi> This is one of his miſtes, whereby hee would haue euerie one doubt, whether hee hath faith or no, and ſo doubt whether hee ſhould bee ſaued or no. But this doctrine is contrarie to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who thus writes to the Church of Corinth:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.5.</note> 
                        <hi>Trie your ſelues</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>and ſearch your ſelues, whether you bee in faith or no. Doe you not know your ſelues, that Ieſus Chriſt is in you, vnleſſe you bee reprobates?</hi> All Chriſtians muſt knowe, that Ieſus Chriſt is in them, that they are by faith engrafted into him, or elſe they are reprobates. By maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrine, all Chriſtians are reprobates; <hi>For no Chriſtian</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>knowes whether he hath ſuch a faith, as obtaineth remiſſion of his ſinnes:</hi> and then it muſt néedes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that no Chriſtian knowes, that Ieſus Chriſt dwelleth in him; which all ſhoulde knowe: and ſo all are reprobates by his doctrine.<note place="margin">1.

                        <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle writes his Catholique Epiſtle in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to all Chriſtians, and hee ſayeth; that <hi>they haue gotten like precious faith to the Apoſtles:</hi> And ſhall they not know then, that they haue obtained ſuch a faith, as is required to the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes? The Papiſtes imagine God to bee a reſpecter of perſons; and that to the Apoſtles hee gaue a great faith, and that they might bee ſure of their ſaluation; but to none elſe, hee gaue the like faith; and that all others ought to doubt: but Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> here plainlie teacheth, that euen thoſe to whome he wrote, had obtained euen as precious a faith as he. And ſhall not we iudge ſo of our Chriſtians at this daie? Naie in the Acts he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſame ſentence,<note place="margin">Act. 10 34.</note> 
                        <hi>that God is no reſpecter of perſons, that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Nation he is accepted vnto him, which feareth him and worketh righteouſneſſe.

                     <p>But Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would ſame peruert this place, and make it ſerue for their doubtfull vncertaintie of ſaluation, and firſt he ſaith, that <hi>Salomon ſpeakes only of iuſt men,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Iuſtificat. lib. 3. cap. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>as thoſe words declare: <hi>There are iuſt men, and wiſe men, and their works are in the hand of God; and man knoweth not,</hi>
                        </hi> that is, <hi>the iuſt man</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>whether he be worthy of loue or hatred.</hi> Firſt Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſſenteth from <hi>Arrias Montanus,</hi> and from the Hebrew, where it is, that the ſeruices of the iuſt men are in the handes of God, &amp; not their workes: And maie more properlie be referred to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes and to liuing creatures, which are properlie rather ſaide, to be in the handes of God, then anie qualities or vnſenſible workes of man. Secondlie, he makes a coniunction copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, betwixt this former ſentence and the other, which is not in the Hebrew: but they are rather two diſtinct ſentences, and of diuers matters. And this ſentence of loue and hatred hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence with that which followes rather, then with this precedent; as the verie Text it ſelfe, being indifferentlie weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, declares, which is this: <hi>Alſo hatred, alſo loue no man knowes; all things are before their faces: all things happen to all men
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25632:92"/> alike; as well to the wicked as to the godly:</hi> And therefore, as by theſe outward workes, no man knowes the loue or hatred, either of himſelfe, or of anie other. The former ſentence in the firſt verſe going before of the iuſt and wiſe men, hath this peculiar doctrine; that no man is ſaued by his owne ſtrength or wiſedome, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the iuſt men and wiſeſt of the world are in the hands of God; he holdes them vp: how much more then other baſer or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner men? This is the doctrine of that verſe: and then followes this ſecond verſe, that <hi>No man knowes his loue nor his hatred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things chance to all men alike.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas Maſter <hi>Caluine</hi> alleadgeth, that this reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie following, prooues euidentlie that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of the knowledge which maie be had by euents: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, <hi>that it is not neceſſary, that the reaſon ſhould be as large as the concluſion, which is prooued by the reaſon.</hi> But heere howe doth he diſſent from reaſon? for it is neceſſarie, that the reaſon be as ample at the leaſt, naie rather amplier, then the concluſion; or elſe the concluſion is naught: euen as the foundation of a building muſt be larger then the toppe, or elſe the builders will make but a tottering building.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie he ſaieth, <hi>that Salomon would proue, that iuſt men could not ſurely know, whether they were beloued of God or no.</hi> Whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> in this verſe, ſpeakes of man ſimplie, and not of the iuſt onelie; as in the former. Then hee ſaieth, that <hi>all things are kept vncertaine to the time to come, till we ſhall haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into life euerlaſting.</hi> But the meaning of <hi>Salomon</hi> is, that all the euents of the time to come in this our life, are vncertain; as the Hebrew phraſe declares: <hi>All things are before our eies;</hi> that is, are vncertaine. While they are here, men cannot ſee, what will happen, till it happen.</p>
                     <p>Laſtlie he anſweres, <hi>that the iuſt man may know, whether hee be worthy of loue or hatred, if the ſpirite of God reueale it vnto him: but ordinarily he ſaith, that the ſpirit of God doth not reueale that to any man, by manifeſt knowledge, but by certaine experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or inward comforts, which do not make certain credit or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> O diueliſh doctrine, and abſurde againſt reaſon!</p>

                        <hi>Seneca</hi> writes thus verie excellently: <hi>Our life without a full ſet purpoſe or reſolution is wandring and vaine. If a man purpoſe a thing, he will do it indeed. I thinke you will grant</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that

And we affirme</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that can be euident to none, without the ſpeciall reuelation of the holy Ghoſt.

But hée doubtes whether the <hi>holy Ghoſt doth teſtifie this ſo to any mans conſcience or no, without ſpeciall and extraordinary reuelation.</hi> But that doubt ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> plainely takes away, who affirmes, that the <hi>holy Ghoſt beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the Sonnes of God.</hi> And that it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſeth thus much vnto vs, but alſo makes vs cry, <hi>Abba, father,</hi> which is the effect of this teſtimony, and aſſurance. For without this teſtimony and aſſurance, who durſt be ſo bolde?

                        <hi>Ferus</hi> alſo (as I haue noted before) affirmeth, <hi>that as Chriſt had witneſſe from heauen and on earth, that he was the onely true

Firſt, the Father from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen witneſſeth, they ſhall be my ſonnes and my daughters, and I wil be their father. Secondly, the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we are the ſonnes of God. And thirdly, the Sacrament of Baptiſme, wherewith we are waſhed; and the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, wherewith we are ſed, doth witneſſe the ſame:</hi> what can then be more happie then a Chriſtian, ſaith <hi>Ferus,</hi> that hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Teſtimonies?</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that <hi>Salomon ſpake generally of the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which iuſt men haue of their proper grace, either as men, or as the ſonnes of God; may be gathered of two things, firſt of theſe words, that <hi>all things are kept vncertaine, or before their faces,</hi>
                        </hi> But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt not miſtake <hi>Salomon;</hi> for all things are not kept vncertaine, as the words ſeeme to import: for then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our faith ſhould bee vncertaine, which I thinke <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> will not affirme: among which Articles alſo are contained the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the reſurrection of the bodie; I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell why they will not make the one of theſe, as certaine to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans conſcience as the other? So that then, theſe words of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that all things are vncertain, muſt be reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their limits: and to bee vnderſtood, in that reſpect hee ſpake them, which the words following doe declare; that is, that by theſe externall euents a man cannot iudge anie thing, but all things are vncertaine.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaieth, that <hi>of the intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Salomon,</hi> this may be gathered, which was to ſhew, that this was one of the miſeries of this life, and that not the leaſt, that euen iuſt men might iuſtly feare, leaſt peraduenture they were not iuſt: but if they knew they were iuſt, howſoeuer they know it; then</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>all things were not reſerued as vncertaine to come.</hi> But what was <hi>Salomons</hi> purpoſe, appeareth by the Chapter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before: <hi>And I ſee all the worke of God</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>that man cannot find it out; the worke that is done vnder the Sunne:</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25632:94"/> and that no man can attaine to the depth or to the reaſon of them: not to teach (as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth) that <hi>this is not the leaſt miſery of man, to feare whether he be iuſt or no.</hi> And then after <hi>Salomon</hi> hath put downe this his intent and purpoſe; he ſets downe this foundation concerning the matter propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; That all men, whether wiſe or iuſt, whether ſeruants or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are in the hands of God. How ſoeuer God dealeth with men, this is a ſure ground: That be they wiſe and iuſt, they are in the hands of God: and therefore are ſure to be ſaued, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer befall them. <hi>But his loue or hatred</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>man knowes not, for all things happen to the good and wicked alike:</hi> ſo woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are the works of God, that <hi>by them no man can tell his loue or his hatred.</hi> This is <hi>Salomons</hi> drift and purpoſe, as moſt euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeares out of this Text: whereas that firſt ground, <hi>That the iuſt and wiſe men are in the hands of God,</hi> whatſoeuer befalles them, ſeemes to inferre neceſſarilie, this certaintie of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this place: doth not that ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prooue euidentlie the certaintie of our ſaluation? <hi>That the feruent deſire of the creature waiteth,</hi>

                     <p>But if we marke well the natures of theſe thrée, faith, hope, and charitie, wee ſhall plainelie ſee that our hope ſaueth vs, by the meanes of faith: for theſe thrée vertues, faith, hope, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſpring one of another, and haue their diuers obiects.

So that theſe three vertues are, as twinnes, all lincked together, and one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her vertue and force of another: And none of theſe, hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie force without another.

For they know, that there is no father on earth worthy of this name, if he bee compared with their heauenly father. They know that this father hath a care not onely of their bones, but alſo of the very haires of their heads: and that not one of them doth fall without his appointment and will. Theſe and ſuch other like things, they know by faith: And they know alſo by the experience of particular graces, and by his prouidence and louing kindneſſe, which God vſeth towards them; and they know that God will ſo certainly prouide for them in all their neceſſities, that they ſing ioifully with the Prophet: <hi>The Lord gouernes me,</hi> or as ſome other doth tranſlate it: <hi>The Lord doth feed me, and therefore I can lacke nothing.</hi> And after, <hi>Although I walke in the middeſt of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no euill, becauſe thou art with me.</hi> Such like promiſes hath the ſcripture in a thouſand places, and with the truth of theſe the iuſt man is defended, as with a moſt ſure ſhield: and therefore he is neither troubled, nor any whit moued in all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this life.

What droue thee into the ſtable and manger, and caried thee after into a ſtrange land, as a baniſht perſon, but loue? what cauſed thee to take ſuch paines to runne vp and downe, hither and thither, to watch, to endure all the troubles of the long night, to compaſſe about Sea and land, to ſeeke the loſt ſheepe, but loue? What bound Sampſons hands and feet, what powled his head, and bereaued him of al his ſtrength, and made him a laughing ſtocke to his enimies, but the only loue of his ſpouſe Dalilah?

The diuine and Kingly prophet foreſeeing that in his mind, calles <hi>Him bleſſed that ſtudies in the law of God day and night.</hi> For as the ſame in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place teſtifieth: <hi>The law of God is an vndefiled law, conuerting the ſoule, and the Teſtimonie of the Lord is faithfull, and giueth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome euen to children.</hi> For ſuch is the excellency of Gods law, that it conuerts the minds of men from an euill cuſtome, to an honeſt kind of liuing; and to thoſe men which wander and goe out of the way, it ſhewes the right path to obtaine euerlaſting glory. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Pintus. <hi>The which his ſaying if it bee true, (as it is moſt true) then is</hi> Staphilus <hi>and Maiſter</hi> Stapletons <hi>ſentence falſe, that the reading of the ſcriptures ſhould leade manie ſoules to deſtruction: it leades them the waie to euerlaſting life, which wander and go out of the way, ſaith</hi> Pintus.</p>

The heathen Philoſophers, although ſetting apart all priuate and publike actions, they gaue themſelues wholy to ſearch out truth, yet they haue committed to writing their own vaine deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and innumerable vanities. For, <hi>All men are liers,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſayeth. What ſhall I ſpeake of the vnprofitable fictions of the Poets? The Poets ſing of ſtrange, but not credible matters. If ſometimes they affoorde vs any thing that is good, they mingle it vvith a thouſand lyes. But all the holy Scripture is true, all to bee read, all to be ſearched, all to be deuoured. As they which digge mettalles, doe not loſe the leaſt ſcrappes; but if ſo bee that they find any mine of gold, they diligently ſearch after euery vaine, and they take out the earth alſo with the Gold, and they are very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect:

For here is no earth mingled with gold, it is all moſt pure gold, tried to the vttermoſt; yea as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Aboue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold and ſiluer.</hi> In the holy Scriptures, becauſe God is the author of it, <hi>Who can neither be deceiued, nor deceiue anie,</hi> whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is written, is truth; whatſoeuer is taught, is vertue; whatſoeuer is promiſed after death, is immortality and euerlaſting felicity. The word of God giueth light, and directs vs the way to heauen: for the diuine Pſalmiſt ſaith: <hi>Thy word is a lanterne to my feet.</hi> Therefore all that loue God, deſire to heare it: therefore ſaith Chriſt our God: <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods word.</hi> And in Saint Lukes Goſpel: <hi>Bleſſed are they which heare the word of God and keepe it.</hi> O woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull reliques, being ſo precious, and in the world ſo little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med!

They are all heauenly, full of holineſſe, breathing heauenly myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

It is true <hi>(ſayeth hee)</hi> that that belongs chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto them by reaſon of their eſtate and office; yet the men of the world cannot be excuſed, if they haue not alſo a certaine manner of prayer (although they be not in that degree of perfection, which the other be in:) if ſo be that they deſire euer to liue in the feate of God, and not to ſinne mortally. For it is neceſſary, that worldly men haue faith, hope, and charity; humility, and the feare of God; contrition alſo and deuotion, and the hatred of ſinne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all theſe vertues, for the moſt part, as we haue ſaid, proceede of the affection of the mind, which muſt neceſſarily flow from ſome conſideration of the vnderſtanding; if the worldly man haue not theſe conſiderations, how can he preſerue theſe vertues? How can a man continue faithfull, vnleſſe hee often meditate on thoſe things which faith commandeth? How can hee bee inflamed with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſtrengthened in hope, brideled through the feare of God, bee moued to deuotion and contrition, and the contempt of himſelfe, wherein conſiſts the vertue of humility, which belongs to all theſe vertues; if he doe not frame himſelfe to meditate vpon thoſe things, by which thoſe affections (as we haue proued before) are woont to be kindled?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And a little after:</hi> Hitherto may be added the dangers of the world, and that great difficulty which man feeles herein, that he can hardly keepe himſelfe free from ſinne, in ſuch a fraile body, in ſuch a dangerous world, and amongſt ſo many enemies which we haue. Therefore although thou be not a religious man, and thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe not bind thee, yet looke that the greatnes of the perill thou art in, do bind thee. I confeſſe truly, that the ſtate of a religious man is very hard and great; but thy danger is greater, then his. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man is looked vnto of his ſuperior; he is kept in of his cloiſter, he is fenced as it were, and walled about with his attendance, with his obedience, with prayer, with faſting, with ſaying his ſeruice, with the ſtrictnes of his order, with good company, and with all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and buſineſſes, which belong to the monaſtery. But the man that liueth in the world, beſides that he is naked and deſtitute of all theſe helpes, he is compaſſed about on euery ſide with Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and Scorpions, he walks euer vpon ſerpents and Cocatrices, both at home and abroad, both in himſelfe, and without himſelfe;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:25632:109"/> in his doores and windowes night and day, a thouſand kind of ſnares are ſet in his way, amongſt all which hee is bound to keepe a pure heart, chaſt eyes, and a cleane body, euer in the midſt of the flame of his youth, and of the euill companies and examples of this life; wherein he ſees or heares nothing that taſteth of God. Wherefore if the religious man (who is a Souldiour by profeſſion) ought euer to go armed, how much more behooueth it, that a man of this world ſhould euer goe armed; who is not ſo ſafe as the other, not ſo much for the ſtrict bond of the ſtate of his perfection, then as for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the dangers, wherein he is. Thoſe which haue ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, whom they doe feare, doe goe no leſſe armed then Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: thoſe for their othe wherewith they are bound; theſe for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Amongſt theſe weapons, we put not onely prayer, but faſting alſo, and ſilence, and reading and hearing of the word of God, the receiuing of the Sacraments, the eſchewing of the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne, and other corporall exerciſes, which all are as it were a<note n="*" place="margin">Salſitudo quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</note> brine (as we call it) which preſerue this our carnall nature prone to vices, leaſt it putrifie, and wormes be ingendered in it. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Granatenſis: <hi>wherein he plainelie prooues, that Laie men, as well as cleargie or religious men, are bound to ſtudie and reade, and meditate vpon the Scriptures. For how elſe can they haue faith (ſayeth hee) or hope, or charitie, without which none can bee ſaued? how elſe can they withſtand their enimies? amongſt the midſt of whome we dailie walke.

Therefore it is very profitable to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in the reading of holy Bookes, that when the mind would thinke or meditate of any matter, it might meditate on thoſe things wherewith it was occupied. For this cauſe Saint Ierome doeth ſo greatly commend the reading of the holy Scripture in all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but eſpecially in that which hee wrote to Demetriades the Virgine: in the beginning wherof he ſayeth thus O thou daughter of God, I wil commend this one thing vnto thee, and one aboue all

And in the end of his Epiſtle he repeates the ſame counſell againe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I ioine the end and the beginning together: neither I thinke it ſufficient to haue admoniſhed thee once; loue the holy Scriptures, and wiſedome ſhall loue thee; loue hir, and ſhe ſhall preſerue thee; honour hir, and ſhe ſhall embrace thee.</p>

For firſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones are not fodder for bruite beaſts: A Swine had rather haue durt and mire, then gold: and a Dogge had rather haue a rotten Carion, then all the holy things in the world.

After the ſame manner, ſaith Chriſt, ye poſſeſſe thoſe things which are holy indeed, and which farre ſurpaſſe all precious ſtones, be they neuer of ſo great price; therefore giue not to Dogges, &amp;c. I would haue you willing to doe good to all men, bearing with thoſe, which do you wrong, hauing compaſſion on thoſe which fall through mans infirmity; yea euen towards the froward, I would haue you cary that mind, that you had rather haue them corrected and amended, then periſh: Yet in preaching the Goſpell to thoſe which openly deſpiſe holſome doctrine, and in whom there ſeemes to be no hope of amendment; yea by occaſion of your preaching which ſhall ſeeme to be worſe then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; to ſuch I will not haue you impart the ſecrets of the heauenly doctrine, leaſt that befall you which happeneth, as if one ſhould throw pearles before ſwine, or ſhould giue dogges that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

But now, becauſe the eſtate of our miſerable life hath driuen vs to this neceſſitie; we muſt waite for a conuenient time to be employed to this kinde of ſtudie: that is, firſt of all we muſt take care, that our workes haue a ſure foundation, and that vertues houſes be firſt built ſurely, eſpecially in yoong Schollers; that they may be able to ſuſtaine the waight of this ſtudie without any dammage. But when as yet our works are raw, and the youth is nurſed with the milke of Chriſt, to haue him called away from his breaſts to the peaſe coddes of the heathen Philoſophers, where nothing is to bee found but ſubtilties and ſophiſtrie, it is a lamentable thing. For tell me, I praie you, if we marke this thing well, what is it els but to do as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, that he might deſtroy the people of God, when as he commanded all the males, as ſoone as they were borne, to be caſt out and drowned in the waters of Egypt?

                        <note place="margin">Gra. de ration. bene viuend. ca. 10.</note> A good reſolution is much furthered by reading of godly and profitable bookes: For this is a thing moſt profitable; as contrariewiſe, the reading of vaine matters is moſt peſtilent and dangerous: For the word of God is our light, our phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, our meate and our guide. The word of God filles our will with good deſires, and it gathers together the diſtracted ſenſes of our mindes, and kindles deuotion in vs, when as it ſeemes now quite to be ſmothered in the aſhes of our infirmities, and as it were quite put out. Beſides this alſo, this reading driues away idlenes which is the originall of all vices, as we will teach hereafter. To conclude, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall foode is neceſſarie to the preſeruation of naturall life; ſo the word of God is neceſſarie to preſerue the ſpirituall life: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, It is the foode of the ſoule to meditate day and night in the word of God. For by this exerciſe, the ſoule is fed with the knowledge of the trueth, and the will with the loue and ſweetnes of it. And when as the vnderſtanding and the will are as it were, two principall wheeles of a clocke, that is, of a life that is rightly gouerned, if they moue in order, and as they ought, all the whole worke and whatſoeuer dependes thereon, ſhall be perfectly ordered. In this holy reading a man ſeeth his wants: he reſolueth his doubts: he findes remedies to keepe in ſtore againſt tribulations: there are good counſels alſo afforded him: there he learns many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; he is ſtrengthened by the examples of vertues, and he learnes the profit that comes by them. And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſo highly commendes it in his Prouerbes: Keepe (ſaith hee) my ſonne the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:25632:113"/> precepts of thy father, and forſake not the law of thy mother. Binde them in thy heart continually, and knit them about thy necke. When as thou walkeſt any whither, let them go with thee; and when thou ſleepeſt, let them preſerue thee: and when thou awakeſt talke with them, becauſe the commaundement is a lanterne; the law a light, and the nurture of diſcipline the way of life. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Granatenſis. <hi>Where he plainely condemnes that poſition of other Papiſtes, that the reading of the ſcripture is daungerous: Nay hée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes that which in their blind kingdome, when as Gods word was baniſhed, they allowed, that is, the reading of vaine Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; as of</hi> Beuis <hi>and ſuch like. That (ſaith he) is moſt dangerous.

Neither onely in the day time did he this, but alſo by night in his heart; as in another place he teſtifieth of himſelfe. How many of vs doe paſſe ouer whole daies and monethes, without euer entering into theſe meditations: Nay God grant that there be not many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the world, which know not what theſe meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s meane. We beleeue in groſſe, the myſteries of our Chriſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith: as that there is a Hell, a Heauen, a reward for vertue, a puniſhment for vice, a iudgement to come, and an account to be made and the like; but for that we chew them not well, by deepe conſideration, and doe not digeſt them well in our hearts, by the heat of meditation, they helpe vs little to good life, no more then a preſeruatiue put in a mans pocket, can helpe his health, &amp;c.</p>

And as it was a wonderfull thing, that Chriſts hand ſhould giue ſight to the blinde, and ſhould cleanſe the Lepour; ſo it was farre more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, that his very word ſhould giue life to dead ſoules. For the words of Chriſt did not only ſtirre vp the mindes of his hearers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did only perſwade them as other preachers are wont to doe, but they had alſo ſuch a vertue and power, that they ſeemed euen to compel the hearers, that they ſhould doe that which he preached.

So they truely which are Gods children, delight to heare thoſe things which are of God: but they which are not of God, but haue the Diuell to their father, as obſtinate children they delight not to heare Gods word: And therefore the Lord ſaid vnto them; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you heare not, becauſe you are not of God.</hi> Whoſe are they then? <hi>You</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are of your father the Diuell:</hi> and therefore you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to heare his wordes, and communication; as murmurings, blaſphemies, filthie and diſhoneſt words. One of the chiefeſt ſignes whereby it may be knowne, whether one be predeſtinate or no, is this: whether he delite to heare the word of God, and ſermons?

                        <hi>Of the ſufficiencie of the ſcriptures,</hi> Ferus <hi>writes thus: <hi>I haue as yet many things to ſay vnto you:</hi>
                        </hi> That which he ſaid before ſeemes contrarie to this: <hi>Whatſoeuer I haue heard of my father, I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto you.</hi> But they are not contrarie: For firſt that which he ſaies, I haue declared vnto you; he takes the preterperfect tenſe, for the future tenſe, for the certaintie of this doctrine; which is a familiar thing in the writing of the prophets: As, when as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was wounded for our iniquities,</hi> which notwithſtanding chanced long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">Compare this doctrine with the Rhemiſts doctrine.</note> Then, Chriſt alſo in trueth hath reuealed all things vnto vs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for our ſaluation, becauſe hee hath preached the Goſpell, which is the fountaine of all trueth: For whatſoeuer the ſpirit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after hath reuealed to the Church, proceeded our of this fountaine. So that trueth, which the holy Ghoſt reuealed in the firſt councell of the Apoſtles, that is, that circumciſion and other legall ceremonies, were not neceſſarie to ſaluation; came not from any where elſe, then from the goſpell; where Chriſt plainely ſhewes, that we haue ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation through faith in him, and not of the workes of the law. So that trueth, that the ſonne is conſubſtantiall to his father, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Nicene Councell againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> iſſued out of the goſpel: for although that word <hi>Homouſion</hi> or conſubſtantial, be not found in the Goſpell; yet there are found there other wordes of as great force: as I, &amp; my father are one. <hi>Héere we may note firſt, that that place: <hi>I haue many things to ſay vnto you:</hi> by</hi> Ferus <hi>a papiſts iudgement, makes nothing for traditions, or vnwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Secondly that the holy Ghoſt reuealeth to the Church no new or ſtraunge doctrine, but that which is contained in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:25632:117"/> whereas other papiſtes affirme, that the holy Ghoſt doth reueale doctrines to the Church, beſides the ſcriptures, which are as firmely to be beleeued, as thoſe which are contained in the ſcriptures: Laſtly, that that ſame doctrine of Chriſtes equalitie with God his father,</hi> Ferus <hi>acknowledgeth to be gathered out of the ſcriptures.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And after vpon the ſame wordes, he writes thus. <hi>I haue as yet many things to ſay to you:</hi>
                        </hi> The Apoſtles had forgotten many things; and many things they did not vnderſtand aright; many things alſo Chriſt had ſpoken obſcurely, the which might be drawen into a wrong ſenſe; the which after chanced in the heretikes. Therefore the holy Ghoſt was neceſſarie for them, which might bring into their memories thoſe things they had forgotten, and ſhould lighten thoſe things they vnderſtood not, and ſhould giue the true meaning of all obſcure ſayings. Therefore this word may be referred to the whole goſpell, as though he ſhoul ſay: although I haue taught you many things, yet you neede further inſtructions, for the cauſes now mentioned. <hi>He ſhall ſpeake all things which he ſhall heare;</hi> that is, which truely are, and indeed ſtand faſt, and haue authoritie in the ſcriptures; deuiſing nothing of his owne, peruerting or miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing: heere we may learne, what is to be preached, &amp; taught in the Church, or elſe we ſhall heare that: <hi>I ſpeake not to them,</hi> and yet they prophecied.</p>

                        <hi>Héere we may plainely ſée, what doctrine</hi> Ferus <hi>would haue taught and preached in the Church, onely the ſcriptures, and ſuch as the holy Ghoſt doth drawe out of them,</hi>

                        <hi>And in another place, he writes thus of Chriſt:</hi> I am the way of life, the trueth of doctrine, and the life of ſaluation: all men deſire the way, the trueth and the life. <hi>Theſe are not any where found certaine or ſure, ſauing in Chriſt.</hi>

                        <hi>And of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the ſcriptures, he writes thus.</hi> As in the latter daies, the word of God came clad with fleſh into the world; and it was one thing that was ſeene, and another that was vnderſtood; the ſight of the fleſh in him was apparant to all men, but the knowledge of his diuinitie, was giuen but to a few and to his elect: ſo the word of God, and the ſpirit is couered with the vaile of the letter: The letter is looked vpon, as the fleſh; and the ſpirit lying hid within is perceiued, like the deitie. And as the ſheepheards being taught of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:25632:118"/> the Angels, knew Chriſt in his ragges and ſimple ſwathling clothes, who otherwiſe would neuer haue beleeued that, that childe was Chriſt, although they had ſeene him a thouſand times, his clothes were ſo baſe &amp; of no great coſt: So the letter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture is plaine, and it ſeemes often to ſpeake, of matters of no waight: Therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we be lightened from aboue, it doth not ſeeme, that we ſhould finde Chriſt in them. Ferus <hi>here doth not make the Scriptures a bare or dead letter, as ſome other Papiſtes doe, but a liuing letter; vnder which (being read and ſtudied) Gods ſpirit lieth hid, euen as vnder Chriſts fleſh his diuinitie.</hi>

For he doth not ſay the words I haue ſpoken, a little before; but the wordes I doe ſpeake, are ſpirit and life: and therefore are my fleſh. For euen as that which containeth a mans ſpirit and life, is his fleſh; euen ſo <hi>(ſaith our Sauiour)</hi> that which containeth my ſpirit and life, is alſo my fleſh. So that by this ſhort ſentence, he exhorteth all men to the reading of his word. Wouldeſt thou be partaker of Chriſts life and ſpirit? then eate his fleſh; that is, read his word, muſe and meditate therein day and night. And no doubt, beleeue the ſaying of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; his wordes he hath ſpoken ſhall be ſpirit and life vnto thee. <hi>Thus we may ſée how</hi> Ferus <hi>doctrine moſt manifeſtly agrées with the doctrine of our Sauiour.

The ſecond worke is, that we apply our ſelues to doe good workes, and to meditate in the Law of God, to heare the word of God, to pray in ſpirit and truth. Eſpecially therefore the word of God is to be heard, without which, there is no hallowing of it: know that this is commanded thee of God, that thou heare his word and keepe it: and of this, he will require an account of thee, in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

The Diuell is euer aſſaulting thee, and thou muſt euer by the word of God reſiſt him, by which alone he is ouercome. Againe, thou muſt meditate of the word of God, or els thou heareſt in vaine. And two things eſpecially are to be meditated out of the word of God, that is to ſay, our ſinnes and Gods goodneſſe.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:25632:120"/> our heart, and to ſerue him faithfully. For although the gift of our creation to his owne image and likeneſſe, and that he would make vs capable of that heauenly inheritance: although I ſay this were a great and an excellent gift; yet notwithſtanding, if God had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs his law, wherein he ſhould declare vnto vs his will, ſhewing vnto vs alſo, what we ſhould doe, that we might obtaine that ſame bleſſedneſſe, for which we were created; without all doubt our life had beene ſorrowfull and miſerable. If a King ſhould ſay to any one: if you ſhall doe that which pleaſeth me, I will aduance you to great honours; ſo that none in my kingdome ſhall be compared vnto you: but contrariwiſe, if you ſhall not doe that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mee, you ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed; yea being faſt bound in chaines, and as it were buried in a darke dungeon, you ſhall die mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably. What thinke you would this man doe, what would hee chiefely care for? Certainly to know the Kings pleaſure, and then with all his endeuour to doe it. For by this meanes, he ſhould gaine the greateſt good thing in the world: and contrarily if he did not this, he ſhould purchaſe himſelfe euerlaſting confuſion. But if the King would not declare to this man his pleaſure, and what thing he delighted in, or what he hated: ſurely this man muſt needs liue a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and ſorrowfull life, vntil he could come to the knowledge of the Kings pleaſure. So <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> commanded his wiſe men vpon paine of death, that they ſhould ſhew him the dreame he had dreamed. But now if the king ſhould declare to this man al his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp; ſhould diſcloſe to him faithfully his very hart; how glad would he be, &amp; how greatly would he reioice; becauſe now he ſaw plainly the gate of his pleaſure opened vnto him. We know aſſuredly, being led not only through faith, but alſo by reaſon, that there is one only God in the world, &amp; there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubts, but that he is good, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful &amp; iuſt. We know alſo aſſuredly, that they which obey the will of this moſt holy God, to be crowned with moſt excellent rewardes in that heauenly kingdome; and againe, that thoſe which offende him impudently with ſins &amp; offences, ſhall be thrown with great ſhame &amp; reproch into that miſerable &amp; darke dungeon of hel. If now God had not giuen vs his law, wherin he had declared to vs as well thoſe things which were to be eſchewed, as thoſe things which were to be embraced, ſorrowfull ſurely and moſt ſorrowfull &amp; heauie had beene the life of man. For although we had knowen that we had bin crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to euerlaſting felicitie, yet we ſhould haue bene vtterly ignorant,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:25632:121"/> how we ſhould haue obtained it: Therefore that great God and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all things, hath beſtowed vpon vs a ſingular and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent benefit, when he did proclaime his law, by which all Chriſtians may plainely vnderſtand, what was neceſſarie to obtaine euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, and what was alſo required to eſchewe that darke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of hell.</p>

There is nothing burnes in hell, but mans owne will; the which man had rather fulfill then the will of God. So the Lord God himſelfe witneſſeth: <hi>Of olde times thou haſt broken the yoke, and burſt my bonds, and haſt ſaid I will not ſerue the Lord, but will walke after mine owne deuiſes.</hi> From the ſmalleſt to the greateſt, all will fulfill their owne willes: euery one is ruled by his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; doth that which ſeemeth good to himſelf. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Stella.

The new Teſtament</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus) is nothing elſe but a manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe things which were ſealed vp in the old, vnder the rude let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; vnder diuers figures. The which thing is excellently declared vnder the figure of a booke ſealed, which none could open but the Lambe that was ſlaine: and hereof it came to paſſe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their preachings opened the ſcriptures; and hence it is, that Chriſt wrote nothing, but preached by worde of mouth, that which was conteined in the olde lawe. And alſo ſewe of the Apoſtles wrote any thing: And if any of them did write, they would onely teach things that were contained in the olde.</hi> If this be true, then the ſcripture, which the Papiſts cal <hi>traditione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> is not of like force with that which is <hi>ſcripta,</hi> or written. Secondly, then the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we are to beléeue, are commended to vs in the worde of God: and are the ſame, that are contained in the written word of God.</p>
                     <p>For ſuch traditions onely, the Iewes were commaunded to obſerue. As we read in <hi>Ieremie; <hi>Stand by the waies,</hi>

For firſt, as Leuen is added outwardly, and is of another nature; ſo it is falſe doctrine whatſoeuer is added to the word of God, or is mingled with it, as either an externall or a contrarie thing: for the word of God is pure bread, not mingled with any other thing, to which nothing muſt be added, or put to of man: according to that, <hi>thou ſhalt adde nothing to my words.</hi>

Thou haſt an example hereof in <hi>Saul,</hi> who of <hi>Amelecke</hi> reſerued oxen for the ſacrifice of God, to whom it was ſaid: <hi>Doth God delight in burnt offrings?</hi> They are like to him, to whom thoſe things ſeeme better, which they chuſe themſelues, then Gods commandements: yea, they deſpiſe Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for their owne inuentions. To conclude, there is nothing good, that is contrarie to Gods commandements: for the will of God is the rule of righteouſneſſe: and his commandement is a ſigne
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:25632:126"/> of his will: therefore doe not that which ſeemeth good in thy own iudgement.</hi> Thus much <hi>Ferus.</hi> And yet ſuch like were manie of their workes, they did in Poperie; they had no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the word of God to warrant them. And all ſuch works by <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement, could not pleaſe God, no more then <hi>Sauls</hi> ſacrifice of the ſhéepe of the Amalekites did: and yet manie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes will vſe ſuch works ſtill.</p>
                     <p>And in another place hee writes thus:<note place="margin">Fer. in 11. cap Mat.</note>

How ſoone had they loſt the true tradition of faſting which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practiſed, euen in <hi>Euſebius</hi> daies: And ſhall wee nowe in the ende of the worlde, grounde our faithes vpon traditions?</p>

                        <hi>that which he ſaid that they knew, he would not vtter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we which know not, which they knew, deſire to come to the knowledge of that which the Apoſtle ment, with great labour; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we attaine vnto it: becauſe that thoſe things which he added haue made the ſenſe alſo more obſcure: for what meanes this; nowe the myſterie of iniquitie worketh; let him onely that now hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, holde till he be taken out of the waie, and then that wicked one ſhall be reuealed: I plainely heere confeſſe my ſelfe to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what he hath ſaid, yet I will not keepe cloſe the ſuſpitions and ſurmiſes of men which I haue read or heard concerning this matter.</hi>

                        <hi>when as yet being but a childe, I was with <hi>Policarpe</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who then didſt verie well, whileſt as yet thou remainedſt within the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours palace, and didſt ſtudie to pleaſe <hi>Policarpe.</hi> For I remember farre better the things which were done then, then they which are done now, becauſe thoſe things we learne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are children, grow vp in vs with our minde, and doe cleaue faſt vnto it. Wherefore alſo I can tell thee, the place wherein <hi>Policarpe</hi> did ſit, when as he did diſpute; and alſo his manner of going, his countenance, the maner of all his life, and alſo his apparell; and alſo his ſermons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes he made to the people; and alſo howe he liued with <hi>Iohn;</hi> and how he was wont alſo to tell of others which had ſeen the Lord; and alſo how he remembred all the words which the Lord ſpake, which he had heard of them; and of his miracles and doctrine: and yet notwithſtanding, he reported all theſe, agreeing to the ſcriptures: the which things I then of the mercie of God, which he vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to beſtow vpon me, hearing attentiuely and diligently, did write not in papers, but in my heart, and which thinges (by the grace of God) I yet keepe faithfully, and doe as it were chew them ouer againe with my ſelfe, without ceaſing. I take God to witneſſe, and in his ſight I affirme vnto thee, that if that bleſſed &amp; Apoſtolical man <hi>Policarpe</hi> had heard any ſuch matter, as thou nowe teacheſt, he would by and by haue cried out, and would haue ſtopped his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:25632:129"/> eares: and as his manner was, he would haue ſaid: O good God, into what times haſt thou reſerued me, that I ſhould heare theſe things? Would not he alſo, by and by haue fled from the place, where ſitting or ſtanding he ſhould haue heard ſuch words?</hi> Héere we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee what maner of traditions they were, which the fathers kept, and in the commendations wherof, they wrote: that is, ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as were agréeable to the ſcriptures, and no other. And this one place of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> may be a rule to ſquare all other places of fathers whoſoeuer, when they highly commend traditions.

                        <hi>as appeareth by the manifolde dreames and ſtrange opinions of the Rabbins, beſides the ſcriptures. As that before the world, God had created ſeuen things, that is to ſay, paradiſe, the law, the iuſt men, the throne of maieſtie, Ieruſalem, and Meſſias.

                        <hi>for her pride. Againe, All the Rabbines of the Hebrewes thinke generally, that the waters which increaſed in the floud, were hotte, and that ſo the fiſhes alſo periſhed.</hi> What are all theſe; but ſathans plantes? ſo ouerſhadow the Lords trueth. So likewiſe amongſt vs Chriſtians in the time of the Goſpell, hee hath not beene idle: He hath mixed his droſſe amongſt the Lords gold: as appeares in the Popes Legend and other Hiſtories. <hi>Longinus was a certaine Centurion, who ſtanding with other ſoldiers</hi> (ſaith their <hi>Legend) by the commaundement of <hi>Pilate,</hi>

And after: ſeeing the ſignes which then happened, that is, the ſunne to be darkened, and the earthquake, he beleeued, but eſpecially for this cauſe (as ſome ſay) that when as his eies were dimmed, either by ſome infirmity, or by age, by chance ſome of the blood, which ranne out of Chriſts ſide, running downe his ſpeare, touched his eies, and preſently he ſaw moſt cleerely.</hi> This is one of their traditions. But <hi>Granatenſis</hi> as ſhould ſéeme not liking this fable, in his meditations of Chriſtes paſſion: <hi>I thanke thee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>O Lord Ieſu,</hi>

                     <p>So likewiſe they haue added manie things to the other ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God: as in an olde printed booke in verſe, made in thoſe daies, I read thus of <hi>Putifats</hi> wife and <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſaid (Madam) I will be true to my Lord; Traitor will I neuer be to my Soueraigne: Therefore beleeue me at a word, Rather then do ſo, I had rather be ſlaine. With that loude did ſhe crie and brake her lace in twaine, And ſmote her noſe that it guſht out all on bloud: And rent down her ſerket that was of ſilk ful good: She told the Knights that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> would by her laine, And that he tare her robes all aſunder. And helpe had not come the thiefe had me ſlaine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heere is no mention made howe ſhe kept his garment, when he fled away from her, whereof the ſcripture makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but of daſhing her ſelfe on the noſe, and rending her robe, whereof in ſcripture there is no mention.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt originall of bonefires in their Legend,<note place="margin">Leg. aur. in Nat. Ioh. bap.</note> thus wee may read: <hi>The bones of dead beaſtes being out of all places ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, are burnt of ſome vpon this daie, whereof there is two cauſes, as <hi>Iohn Beleth</hi> ſaith: one an obſeruation of an auncient cuſtome: for there are certaine beaſts called Dragons, which doe flye in the ayre, and ſwimme in the water, and goe on the earth: and ſometime when as they goe on earth, they are inflamed with luſt, and doe throw their ſeede into ſprings and flouds, whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a plaguie and vnholſome yeare. Againſt this, this remedie was founde out, that a fire ſhould be made of the bones of beaſts; and this fire would driue them away: and becauſe this chanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time; therefore yet this of ſome is obſerued. Another cauſe is, to ſignifie vnto vs that the bones of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt were burnt, in the Citie called Sebaſta of the infidels. Alſo then they carie in their hands burning firebrands, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> was a light ſhining &amp; burning. And they turne about a wheele, becauſe then the ſunne declines in his circle, to ſignifie that the fame of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Chriſt, did deſcende and diminiſh.</hi> What preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiues againſt Dragons; what doctrines for their ſoules, were theſe?<note place="margin">Io. 5 35.</note> Eſpecially when as they neuer then heard in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>a burning light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that fable of <hi>Formoſus</hi> is notable,<note place="margin">Faſc. Tem. 6 aetate. Chriſti. an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dom. 9 14.</note> which <hi>Faſciculus Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum</hi> makes mention of. <hi>This <hi>Sergius</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith that booke) <hi>when as he came to Rome by the ayde of the French men, tooke <hi>Christopher</hi> the Antipope, and ſate in his ſteed. And to reuenge his repulſe, he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:25632:130"/> drew the body of <hi>Formoſus</hi> out of his graue, and being clothed like the Pope, he commanded his head to be chopt off in his pontificall chaire, and to be throwne into Tiber. But the fiſhers brought him into the Church, the Images bowing themſelues vnto him, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting him reuerently, as all they did ſee which were preſent.</hi> This is reported in that hiſtorie. And after, <hi>Fulbertus <hi>Byſhop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notenſis, in his ſickneſſe was viſited of the bleſſed Virgin Marie, and reſtored againe with her moſt bleſſed milke.</hi>
                        </hi> Alſo of the viſitation of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they ſaie in their Legend, <hi>that the bleſſed Virgin car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with her Couſin three moneths, waiting vpon her, and that ſhe tooke the childe being borne in her holy armes from the ground; as it is written in the Scholaſticall hiſtorie; and did moſt diligently the dutie of a nurſe carrying him about.</hi> This teacheth their Legend. Whereas the Goſpel ſaith, that ſhe abode with her thrée moneths, and after returned to her owne houſe:<note place="margin">Luc. 1.56.</note> and that when <hi>Elizabeths time was comed, that ſhe ſhould be deliuered, ſhe brought forth a forme; and her neighbours and Couſins reioiced with her.</hi> But this as ſhould ſéeme, was after <hi>Maries</hi> departure. And this <hi>Stella</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes alſo in <hi>2. cap. Luc.</hi> Thus <hi>they erre not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That miracle is ſtrange of <hi>Germanus</hi> the Byſhop of Antiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,<note place="margin">Faſc. temp.

But to conclude this matter (for of miracles I ſhall haue an occaſion to ſpeake hereafter) <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicus Viues</hi> a Papiſt writes thus of <hi>Legenda aurea.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lud. Viu. de cauſ. corr. art. lib. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>The French men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>write of the French, and the Italians of the Italique, and the Spaniards of the Spaniſh, and the Germans of the German, and the Engliſh men of Engliſh affaires; and ſome others, to pleaſe ſome other countrey. And the Author thinkes, that he hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently plaied his part, if he haue commended as much as he can that nation: he reſpects not the truth of the matter, but the glorie of the countrey. Neither in the writings of the acts of the Saints is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater regard of truth, in which all things ought to be exact and abſolute. Euerie one wrote their actes, as he was affected towards them: ſo that the Authors affection indited the hiſtorie, and not the truth. How vnworthy of the Saints and chriſtian men is that hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Saints, which is called the <hi>Golden-Legend,</hi> which I cannot tell why they call it golden, when as it was written of a man hauing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:25632:130"/> an yron mouth and a leaden heart: what thing can be named more diſhonourable then that booke? Oh what a great ſhame is it to vs chriſtians! that the moſt famous actes of our Saints are not more truely and ſincerely committed to memorie, either for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or imitation of ſo excellent vertues, as were in them? when as the Greeke and Roman writers haue written ſo diligently of their captaines, Philoſophers and wiſe men.</hi> Thus much <hi>Ludouicus Viues</hi> affirms. He ſmelled Satans ſleights in theſe matters. He was not aſhamed to confeſſe his blackneſſe: and that euen the moſt part of their Legends are lies. I could wiſh that all true Catholiques would doe the like, and marke well what S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>that Antichriſt ſhall come by the working of Sathan,</hi>

                        <hi>We haue not as yet touched the greateſt euill, wherewith they are afflicted: and what (I pray you) is that, you will ſaie vnto me? their raging madneſſe, by which they hauing forſaken the ſtudie of the law and the Prophets, they haue gotten vnto themſelues other learned helpes. <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (ſaith the Lord himſelfe) <hi>for they beare witneſſe of me.</hi> That this thing, which Chriſt commands, the Iewes might not eaſily doe; Sathan by his ſleight and ſubtiltie deuiſed, that they deſpiſing the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures, might ſpend all their life in ſtudying of poyſoned and hurtfull doctrines. The Greeke and Latine Poets faine many things, but yet wittily and finely, not to deceiue any but to delight; from whoſe fables many things may be verie fitly applyed to our maners and to our life: but the Iewes inuent and coine ſuch things which haue no delight in them at all. For they are verie abſurd and fooliſh, not beautified with any eloquence of wordes or of ſpeech, which they haue committed to writing; not that they might delight the mindes, but that they might intangle them with errors. For they ſay that God did not make perfect the heauens, and that the light of the Moone was diminiſhed for her pride &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie. And that our firſt father <hi>Adam</hi> before <hi>Eue</hi> was created, had copulation inceſtuouſly with all other beaſts: and that all other trees, when as he had tranſgreſſed the Law of God, did lift vp aloft from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:25632:131"/> him both their leaues and fruits, leaſt he ſhould take any commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by them; and that only the figge tree, becauſe ſhe was guiltie of his offence (for it was the fruit thereof (they ſay) which our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did taſte againſt Gods commandement) did yeeld to them her leaues, wherewith they might couer their priuie parts, &amp;c.</hi> Such vanities Sathan deuiſed for the Iewes, to kéepe them occupied withall, when as they forſooke the ſtudie of the Scriptures. And hath he not done the like in the Popes kingdome? When the ſtudie of the ſcriptures was neglected, as before hath béen ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This <hi>Oſorius</hi> confeſſeth, and wee haue by experience proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true.</p>
                     <p>And after he writes thus: <hi>Thus much onely I will ſay; when as <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his Alchoran hath fained many things not onely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and wickedly; but alſo fooliſhly and blockiſhly: yet in many places the Iewes in the monſtrouſnes and impudencie of their fables, haue gone beyond <hi>Mahomet.</hi> So that <hi>Mahomet</hi> being compared to them, may ſeeme to bee ſome bodie: And yet theſe Maiſters of the Rabbines are read and learned, and with theſe wicked diſciplines (as <hi>Eſay</hi> propheſied) their youthes are intangled, and theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed into them in their tender yeeres, as Gods teſtimonies.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the like maie wee ſaie of the monſtrous lies and fables which Sathan deuiſed in time of Popery, and were giuen to be taught children in ſteed of Gods worde: as were the fables of <hi>Beuis</hi> of Hampton, <hi>Valentine and Vrſon, Houleglas, Clyme of the Clough,</hi> and ſuch like. Surely all theſe like apples grew of the ſame trée, came no doubt from that father of lies, and from that prince of darkeneſſe Sathan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And being</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>delighted with theſe ſtudies, they deſpiſe the ſtudie of the law of God, and they verie ſeldome take the Prophets into their hands, and they place the chiefe wiſedome nowe in this ſhoppe of madnes, raſhnes, and wickednes.</hi> And doe not manie euen ſo amongſt vs, who will ſeeme religious? They will delight to heare a plaie, or to reade ſome vaine hiſtorie: but the Lawe of God they will not take in their hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> (ſaith <hi>Oſorius) as concerning the maners and dealings of their liues, with what errors and wickednes doe they pollute the puritie of the lawe? For that they expound the law, that it is neceſſarie, that he which is condemned of the greater part of the iudges, ſhall ſuffer puniſhment: But he that is condemned by the ſentences of all the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:25632:131"/> iudges, ſhall be acquited. And he that ſhall go about to kill a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, by falſe witneſſe, ſhall die; but he that ſhall kill one ſhall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued. As though the purpoſe of hurting, without taking effect, were worthy of puniſhment; but hauing obtained his purpoſe, were worthy of praiſe. It is alſo lawfull for them by the decrees of their Rabbines to defraude Chriſtians of their money; to take their liues from them; to beguile any nation; to inuent crafts and deceits; &amp; to wiſh a plague day &amp; night to the innocent, &amp;c.</hi> With ſuch corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and falſe expoſitions of the law is that doctrine ſtuffed, which they call <hi>Talmud;</hi> which profeſſeth that it obſerueth the letter of the law verie diligently.</p>
                     <p>And doth not the Pope ſo expound Gods law, that yet if anie man kill another, he maie diſpenſe with him: Nay that it may be lawfull for the ſubiect to rebell; nay to kill the Prince: what is this but in expounding the law of God to imitate the Iewiſh <hi>Talmud?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But what ſhal I ſpeake of the other part of their law, which they cal Cabala? what great matters doth it take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it? &amp; about what trifles is it occupied? what great promiſes doth it make? And how euil doth it perform them? It promiſeth men heauenly things, and it leaues not miſerable wretches ſcant thoſe things which concerne man. For this it vndertakes, that it will expound the inward meaning of the law, &amp; that it will ſearch out, not the outward letter, but the inward hidden myſterie: And it iudgeth that we muſt lead our liues according to the meaning and not according to the letter of the law, &amp;c. What can be greater, what more ſtatelie then this promiſe? But in the end what more vaine or friuolous? They ſpend their whole life in expounding the name of God, which they cannot attaine vnto, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>With one of theſe two knowledges, the Iewes which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of learning, being greatly delighted; read the ſcriptures careleſly, and they thinke that they are not to be expounded: but by the iudgement either of the Talmudiſts or Cabaliſts: And do not the Papiſts follow their ſteps? They haue bin altogither oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in reading &amp; ſtudying the Maiſter of the Sentences &amp; the Schoolemen: they haue read the ſcriptures careleſly or not at all; and they haue thought that they were to be expounded according to their iudgements. <hi>And whereas</hi> (ſaith <hi>Oſorius) that it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Gods law, that ſoothſayers, which whiſper in their incha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould not be ſought vnto; but that all the dealings of our
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:25632:132"/> life ſhould be referred to the ſquare of the law of God, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie: the Iewes in ſteed of the holineſſe of the law of God, ſeeke to the dregs and corruption of the law, &amp; place the art of magicke which they call Cabala, in Gods place.</hi> What can be ſaid or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more haynous then this?

                     <p>But to concide; as <hi>Oſorius</hi> writes to the Iewes; the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition I would make to all true Catholikes. <hi>I requeſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>but two things at your hands; the one is, that you would deteſt that poyſoned learning, which came nowe from no place elſe but euen from the bottomleſſe pit of hell to the plague of mankinde, and that you would onely aske counſell of the law of God, and of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Prophets. The other thing is, that you woulde not come in your praiers and requeſtes to God, bringing any thing with preiudicate mindes from your forefathers, but with a ſimple heart you would earneſtly deſire of that moſt high fountain of loue &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he would vouchſafe to open to you mercifully, that which is neceſſarie for your ſaluation. The which if you ſhall do, I doe not doubt but that he will lighten your mindes, with the brightneſſe of his holy ſpirit, that then at length you may ſee, what Godhead and power lies hid in Chriſt, nailed vpon the croſſe.</hi> Theſe two requeſts I would alſo make to all Catholikes, that they would now loath the intricate doctrines of the ſchoolemen,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.3. Reue. 9.2. Pſal. 19.3.</note> and loue the ſimplicitie of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt? Surely, <hi>this is that ſmoke that came out of the bottomleſſe pit, which darkened both the ſunne and the ayre,</hi> that is, Ieſus Chriſt, who is the true ſunne of righteouſnes; and the aire, that is, the word of God, which is the aire and life of our ſoules.

                     <p>And although ſome other of the Fathers haue called <hi>Peter</hi> the rocke, vpon which our Sauiour ſaid he would builde his Church; and M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that ſaint <hi>Auſtine, when as he had alſo ſometime affirmed the ſame, retracted it after, becauſe he vnderſtood not the Hebrewe tongue; and thought that <hi>Cephas</hi> did not ſignifie a rocke, but ſome thing deriued from a rocke: as if we ſhould ſay: rockiſh, or of the nature of a rocke.</hi> I anſwere, that <hi>Auſtine</hi> vnderſtood the Gréeke tongue, which plainely expounds this word <hi>Cephas</hi> to be <hi>Petra;</hi> as appeares not onely by ſaint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpell,<note place="margin">Io. 1. 42.</note> but alſo by ſaint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt be called <hi>Cephas,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted <hi>Petrus,</hi> or a ſtone:</hi> no doubt the holy Ghoſt foreſaw how ſome would goe about by this worde <hi>Cephas,</hi> to make <hi>Peter</hi> the rocke, whereon the Church ſhould be builded.

And he gets this new name, who is built vpon this rocke, as thou ſeeſt in <hi>Peter.</hi>
                        </hi> Thus far <hi>Ferus:</hi> Where we may learne eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that he agrées not with M. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who expounds <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> to be a rocke: but he agrées with vs, and with the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof ſet downe in the Goſpell, and cals it a ſtone: and ſo alſo makes <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe to be. Nay, he addes farther (which quite ouerthrowes M. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> aſſertion) that all Chriſtians which are built vpon the rock, which is Ieſus Chriſt, get to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues this new name: why then, if <hi>Cephas</hi> ſignifie a rocke, then all Chriſtians ſhould be rockes; and vpon them alſo, as well as vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhould the Church be builded? But to put the matter out of all doubt, he ſaith plainly, that it is not for any man to be called a rocke, no not for the Pope then, if he be a man. And yet to make it more euident, if it were poſſible; what was his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and iudgement concerning this matter, he addeth: <hi>It belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth only to Chriſt to be a rocke:</hi> What can be more manifeſt then this? Therefore all Catholiques, as M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, do not affirme <hi>Peter</hi> to be the rocke, whereupon the Church was built; or if they do, they do erre, as here <hi>Ferus</hi> forced with truth, doth very manifeſtly proue and confeſſe.</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot let paſſe a ſleight, which ſome Catholikes haue vſed to ſalue this matter: whereas in a copie printed at <hi>Paris 1594.</hi> after <hi>Ferus</hi> death, we read thus as I haue alleaged: <hi>It belongeth onely to Chriſt that he ſhould be the rocke.</hi> In a copie printed at Rome <hi>1597</hi> it is thus read: <hi>It belongs to Chriſt that he ſhould be the firſt &amp; chiefe rocke:</hi> where the word <hi>Onely</hi> is quite left out, and the word <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>chiefe</hi> is put in or added. What dealing is this; to adde or put out at their pleaſures? and that to maintaine the Popes ſupremacie. <hi>Ferus</hi> in his firſt copie ſaith, that <hi>It belongs only to Chriſt to be a rocke.</hi> And the Catholikes in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:25632:134"/> their copie printed at Rome ſay, <hi>It belongs to Chriſt to be the chief rocke:</hi> and put out <hi>onely</hi> and adde <hi>chiefe,</hi> becauſe they would haue the Pope ioined with him. And <hi>Ferus</hi> himſelfe did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this during his life, for both the copies were printed after his death. That at Paris by <hi>Philippus Agricola,</hi> preacher at Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; and as it ſhould ſéeme, <hi>Ferus</hi> ſucceſſour. But howſoeuer they would ſalue the matter, with the word <hi>chiefe</hi> or <hi>firſt, Ferus</hi> hath ſo plainely put downe his iudgement heerein, as all the world may ſée and perceiue their iuggling: for he ſaid before: <hi>It belongs not to any man to be a rocke.</hi> Therefore hee takes awaie plainly all ſecondarie rockes of <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, which they would eſtabliſh.</p>
                     <p>But to declare plainly what <hi>Ferus</hi> meant by the chiefe Rocke, which perchance ſometime he vſeth, he addeth after, vpon theſe words, <hi>And vpon this rock I wil build my church. <hi>What the Church is</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we haue declared elſe where: but now we muſt ſearch out, what is the rocke vpon which the Church is built. The ſcripture ſometime takes a rocke for ſtrength, firmity and ſecuritie, as in the Pſalm. <hi>He hath brought me out of the lake of miſerie, and hath ſet my feet vpon the rocke:</hi> By which words he meanes nothing elſe, then that he was placed in a ſafe and ſure place, that is, in ſafetie. So alſo in another place he ſaith. <hi>Set me vpon a rocke.</hi> When as Chriſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith: <hi>I will build my Church vpon this rocke,</hi> hee meanes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, then he will build his Church vpon a ſure and vnmouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation, againſt which all the aſſaults of his enemies can bee able to do nothing. By this it is manifeſt, that Chriſt built not his Church vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> as a chiefe foundation <hi>For we are built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Ieſus Christ himſelfe being the head corner ſtone)</hi> or vpon any other man: for no man is ſo firme or conſtant that he cannot be moued, as we may alſo ſee in <hi>Peter:</hi> Therefore another rocke is to be ſought for. And truly in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Chriſt himſelfe is often called a rocke or ſtone, as in <hi>Eſay, I will put in Sion a corner ſtone, approued and choſen, whoſoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him ſhall not be confounded</hi> And in the Pſalme. <hi>The ſame ſtone which the builders refuſed is become the head ſtone of the corner.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> comming to Chriſt, as to a liuing ſtone is to be built vpon him. Thou heareſt what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt is that ſtone: then he wils that we all ſhould be ſtones, which then is done, when wee are built vpon Chriſt. And he is built vpon Chriſt, that beleeues in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:25632:135"/> Chriſt, and truſts vpon thoſe things which Chriſt hath, and is able to do. Chriſt therefore is principally the rocke vpon whom the whole Church is built, according to that:</hi> Another foundation can no man lay beſides that which is laid, Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Then becauſe, by a true faith we are ioined to Chriſt: we alſo, after a maner (if wee may ſo ſpeake) as it were become rockes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">All Chriſtians are ſecundarie rockes.</note> 
                        <hi>And therefore the Chriſtian faith it ſelfe, and the truth of the Goſpell, is that firme and vnmoueable rocke, on which Chriſt hath built his Church.</hi> Thus far <hi>Ferus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And héere we may note firſt that the rock, whereon Chriſt will build his Church, muſt be firme, ſure and vnmoueable, againſt which the aſſaults of no enemies can preuaile. Secondly, he ſaith that <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſuch a rock, as we may manifeſtly perceiue. Againe, whereas he ſaith, that he built it not vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> as on a chiefe foundation, he addeth. <hi>For we are builded vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</hi> Amongſt whom he reckons <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And laſtlie he concludes, that principally or chiefly Chriſt is the rocke, vpon which the whole Church is built. And ſecondly, the Chriſtian faith or truth of the Goſpell, is that firme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable rocke, vpon which Chriſt built his Church. So that where <hi>Ferus</hi> doth ſay that Chriſt is the chiefe rock, he meanes not to make <hi>Peter</hi> or his ſucceſſours the ſecond (as the Papiſts doe conceiue) but Chriſtian faith and the truth of the Goſpell. But afterward hee alſo declares moſt euidently what was giuen to <hi>Peter, To thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I wil giue, &amp;c. he promiſeth that he wil giue him the keyes; he gaue them not in this place: therefore let vs ſeeke where he gaue him the keyes indeed. And we ſhall find in no other place, but that which is in <hi>Iohn, Receiue yee the holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſinnes you forgiue, they are forgiuen them: and whoſe ſinnes you ſhall retaine, they ſhall be retained.</hi> The keyes therefore of the kingdome of heauen are power to forgiue or retaine ſinnes. The which alſo is proued out of this place: For Chriſt forthwith added; <hi>Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> But what means this here, to <hi>Peter</hi> only the keyes are promiſed, &amp; yet they are alſo giuen to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? Here I will alleage the ſentence of S. <hi>Ierome:</hi> For the ordinary Gloſſe alleageth him. The other Apoſtles haue (ſaith he) power of Iuriſdiction, to whom it was ſaid after the reſurrection, <hi>Receiue.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Church alſo hath this power in her Biſhops and Prieſts: but therefore they are promiſed ſpecially to <hi>Peter,</hi> that all men may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that whoſoeuer ſhall ſeparate himſelfe from the vnitie of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:25632:135"/> the faith, and from the fellowſhip of the Church, which is but one; neither to be looſed from his ſins, nor can enter into heauen. Thou haſt heard what be the keyes and what is the eccleſiaſticall power: let vs marke the vſe of the keyes, and the execution of this power.</hi> Thus far <hi>Ferus.</hi> Here we may note moſt manifeſtly, both by <hi>Ferus</hi> and <hi>Ieromes</hi> iudgement, that the power and authoritie here promiſed to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, was afterward giuen indéede to all the Apoſtles, and that euerie Church, in her Biſhops and Prieſts hath now the ſame power: what then can the Biſhop of Rome <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, or the Church of Rome brag of, more then any other biſhops or Church? Euerie Church (ſaie <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Ferus</hi>) hath this power, which was promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> in her biſhops and prieſts; and not the Church of Rome or <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſours onely: as now the Patrons of the Church of Rome teach. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were they then promiſed ſpecially to <hi>Peter,</hi> if he alone recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them not? <hi>Ierome</hi> anſwers: <hi>For a myſtery,</hi> not for any ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, <hi>to ſignifie that there ſhould be but one faith &amp; one Church: from which vnitie, whoſoeuer did ſwarne ſhould not be partaker of this remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Agréeing herein with <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who plainly affirmes <hi>that the other Apoſtles were the ſame that <hi>Peter</hi> was,</hi>

And yet they would make the world beléeue, that both Fathers and the Scriptures are on their ſide, and do make for them. If this be true, whie ſhould they then purge out, as ſome lothſome thing, this ſaying of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this expoſition of <hi>Ierome,</hi> for ſo they ſay in their copie printed at Rome: <hi>Commentaries of <hi>Ferus</hi> at Rome peruſed and purged.</hi> Do they vſe to purge ſuch things out? By this we may learne what account they make of the ſcriptures and Fathers. But this their corrupt dealing is not only in this place, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes verie often after in this matter of <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiue, as ſhall appeare.</p>
                     <p>It followes thus after in <hi>Ferus</hi> in the true originall: <hi>Neither can they ſimply, at their owne pleaſure and will remit ſinnes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, but by certaine meanes. Let vs ſeeke therefore what they be: And truly in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> they are moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly expreſſed; for ſo we read in <hi>Matthew, Go teach all nations &amp; baptize them:</hi> and in <hi>Mark, Go you into the whole world, and whoſe ſins you remit, they are remitted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: He that beleeueth and ſhall be baptized, &amp;c.</hi> Behold theſe are the meanes by which the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall power of forgiuing ſinnes is executed, that is to ſay, the preaching of the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of ſacraments: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I find anie other thing elſe giuen to the Apoſtles, by which they may execute their power, then theſe two things.</hi> Here are the meanes <hi>Ferus</hi> plainly ſet downe, by which this eccleſiaſticall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and giuen to him with the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is executed: that is, the preaching of the Goſpell, and the adminiſtration of the ſacraments. And in theſe two the biſhop of Rome hath no more authoritie then anie other biſhops or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of anie other church. So that <hi>Ferus</hi> ſtill kéepes his former iudgement, that he cannot find but that which <hi>Ierome</hi> alſo auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that euery church hath in her biſhops and prieſts, that which was promiſed to <hi>Peter:</hi> and that this power is executed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, then by preaching and adminiſtration of the ſacraments. Then plainely by <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement, he cannot find that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome hath any power left him to execute this eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall authoritie granted to <hi>Peter</hi> and to other biſhops, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of pardons; the which is a principall meanes by which he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:25632:136"/> executeth this autthoritie. <hi>Ferus</hi> can find but two means in the ſcripture, by which this power is executed; the preaching of the Goſpell, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Pardons is a meane deuiſed to enrich the Pope, not found in the ſcriptures. Nay if this be true, he makes in effect the Pope to be Antichriſt: for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the true keies conſiſt in preaching the goſpell, and in the adminiſtration of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then the Pope himſelfe which neuer vſeth anie of theſe, but is altogether occupied in other matters; as in making of pardons, in confirming and depoſing kings, vſeth counterfeit keyes in the houſe of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; vſeth not the true keies: and therefore himſelfe is a counterfeit ſeruant,<note place="margin">Luke. 11.23.</note> and euen Antichriſt himſelfe. For our ſauiour hath ſaid, <hi>Hee that is not with me is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad.</hi> But our Sauiour Chriſt, when he was on earth here, gathered his ſhéepe togther by preaching, as is moſt apparant in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Therefore the Pope which doth not by this meanes gather with him, ſcattereth abroad, and is not a faithfull ſhepheard, but an hireling; not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>atherer, but a ſcatterer; not a fauourer, but a deſtroyer of Chriſts flocke. This doctrine of <hi>Ferus</hi> is manifeſt and truly grounded on the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs ſée how the Popes Patrones haue corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and peruerted it. <hi>Ferus</hi> (as I haue before cited him) hath thus plainlie declared his iudgement in the copie printed at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: but in his copie printed at Rome, thus there they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted his doctrine. <hi>When as they count ſimply, or at their owne pleaſures, or at their owne willes forgiue or retaine ſinnes, but by certaine meanes, let vs ſearch them out; and they truly in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> are moſt manifeſtly expreſſed: for ſo we read in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Go teach all nations, and baptize them.</hi> And in <hi>Marke; Goe into the whole world, he that beleeueth, and is baptized, &amp;c</hi> Behold theſe are the meanes by which the Eccleſiaſticall power of forgiuing of ſinnes is executed: that is to ſay, the ſacraments, which if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, now the kingdome of heauen is opened vnto him, now his ſinnes are forgiuen him: Neither find I any other thing giuen to the Apoſtles, by which they ought to execute their power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> Thus ſaith the Romane copie, where they leaue out the principall meanes of executing this power, that is <hi>preach ng the Goſpell,</hi> to confirme no doubt and maintaine their dumbe Pope
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:25632:137"/> and his Clergie: and whereas <hi>Ferus</hi> can find nothing but theſe two, they leaue out the preaching of the Goſpell, and theſe words <hi>(then theſe two)</hi> and they ſay, <hi>neither can I find any thing els gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Apoſtles to execute their authoritie:</hi> meaning the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What dealing is this, thus to mangle his words? what truth, to take away the principall meanes of the power of forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſinnes from the paſtors of Chriſts Church? And whereas Chriſt hath giuen them as it were two keyes, to ſteale one from them: what is this elſe, but to throwe Gods people into hell? and this dealing to bee at Rome, which calles her ſelfe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, the miſtreſſe of all pietie and religion; what a ſinne is this?</p>
                     <p>But as <hi>Ferus</hi> goeth on further in ſetting forth the truth; ſo do they alſo in their corrupt dealing. <hi>The execution therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus) of the Eccleſiaſticall power conſiſteth in theſe two, that is to ſay, in preaching of the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Neither do we read that the Apoſtles did any other things. To which <hi>Ierome</hi> agrees vpon the 14. of <hi>Eſay.</hi> The Apoſtles (ſaith he) looſe by the word of God, the teſtimonies of the Scriptures, and exhortations of vertues; and as they looſe by the word of God, ſo alſo they looſe by the ſacraments, which are adherents and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants to the word.</hi> Here the Roman copie leaues out <hi>Ferus</hi> drift: <hi>The execution</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus) of Eccleſiaſticall power conſiſts in theſe two, that is, in preaching the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of the ſacraments: Neither do we reade that the Apoſtles did any thing elſe.</hi> This ſentence they leaue out, which is the ſumme of all. They after alleage <hi>Ierom</hi> (as <hi>Ferus</hi> doth) <hi>That they looſe by preaching:</hi> But that the execution of the power Eccleſiaſticall conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe two points; that they leaue out, which ouerthrowes all their Popiſh pardons. And after <hi>Ferus</hi> ſaith: <hi>Theſe things therefore I alleaged in this place, that thou mighteſt ſee, that my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion wherein I ſaid, that the execution of the power eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call did conſiſt in the preaching of the word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, to differ nothing from the ſaying of the ſaints.</hi> This ſentence in the Roman copie is quite left out. That concluſion of <hi>Ferus</hi> they do not like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of theſe things which haue beene ſpoken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion diſſolued eaſily, which troubles ſome, how Prieſts can forgiue ſinnes, when as that only belongs to God, according to that, <hi>I am
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:25632:137"/> he that doth blot out thine iniquities.</hi> And alſo that <hi>Chriſt alone hath the keyes of death and hell.</hi> To which thus it may be anſwered: That onely God forgiues ſinnes by power of dignitie and excellency: but the Apoſtles and their ſuceſſours, like ſeruants, apply theſe things, by which God forgiues ſinnes, and giues grace, as are the word of God and Sacraments.</hi> Here we may learne plainely by <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement, the power and authoritie of forgiuing of ſinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines only in God: the paſtors and miniſters, like poore and humble ſeruants to this great cure, doe but applie thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and remedies, by which God cures. There is no power nor authoritie in them: that is in God alone. Here the Romane co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie leaues out, <hi>that only God forgiues ſinnes by power of dignitie and excellencie:</hi> It is likely they woulde haue that power in their prieſts: They ſaye that <hi>God alone remitteth ſinnes,</hi> but they leaue out theſe wordes, <hi>by the power of dignitie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.</hi>

                        <hi>To conclude</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus) theſe keyes of the Church are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then power of binding and looſing; of forgiuing ſinnes, and retaining them.</hi> But the Roman copie leaues out, <hi>are nothing elſe: To conclude</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the keyes of the Church are power of binding and looſing, of remitting and retaining of ſinnes.

                        <hi>who in the 120. Tract. vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith he) bare a figure of the Church. For properly as much as belongeth to himſelfe by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he was but one man, and by grace one Chriſtian, and by his more aboundant grace but one and the ſame firſt or chiefe Apoſtle. But when it was ſaid to him, <hi>To thee I will giue the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen,</hi> he ſignified the whole Church. Alſo in his booke of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine, the firſt boke and eight chap. he teacheth plainly that the keyes were giuen to the Church.</hi> Here we may plainly ſee by <hi>Auſtines</hi> &amp; <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement, what <hi>Peter</hi> was in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt excellencie, but one &amp; the firſt Apoſtle, giuing him no more prerogatiue, then the Goſpell yéelds vnto him, who in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the twelue Apoſtles, ſaith, the <hi>firſt Simon Peter.</hi> He was as it ſhould ſéeme moſt ancient, therefore in order to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the reſt. Thus much concerning his owne perſon, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:25632:138"/> and <hi>Ferus</hi> attribute to him: but the keyes were giuen to him in another perſon, that is, in the perſon of the Church: and therefore in her name he receiued them, not in his owne name, or for himſelfe and his ſucceſſours. So that by <hi>Auſtines</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe keyes were not giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but as <hi>Ierome</hi> before alſo profeſſed, <hi>that euerie Church in her Biſhops and prieſts receiues that which was giuen to <hi>Peter.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is <hi>Ferus</hi> opinion in his true originall: but the Romane copie hath thus mangled him. <hi>Some</hi> (ſay they) <hi>labour to proue that this was ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>To thee I will giue, &amp;c.</hi> to whom others are contrarie.</hi> Thus far they go in the Roman copie, but they leaue out <hi>Ferus</hi> opinion concerning this matter, and that grounded vpon Saint <hi>Auſtine.</hi> Here we may ſée againe, how little they doe eſtéeme the fathers: and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in truth they do make for them. In this waightie matter of the Popes authoritie, they haue reiected both <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> If they had liked their ſayings, why ſhould they haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them out? And after where <hi>Ferus</hi> declareth how the Church, and alſo how <hi>Peter</hi> receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keies. <hi>I anſwere</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that both is true, that the keies are giuen to the Church, as to the myſtris or ſpouſe, but to <hi>Peter</hi> not as a Lord or maiſter, but as to a miniſter. And to this belongs that which St. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith. <hi>Let a man ſo eſteeme vs as the miniſters of Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame ſayeth againe: I am a debter both to the wiſe and fooliſh. And hereunto belongeth the names of the Apoſtles who in the ſcriptures are called paſtours, watchmen, laborers. To conclude, ſaith <hi>Ferus;</hi> heare what <hi>Bernard</hi> writes to Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> in his ſecond booke of Conſideration. Thy predeceſſors</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the Apoſtles heard that the harueſt is great and the labourers few: challenge therefore the Fathers inheritance; be watchfull in this, and be not idle, leaſt it bee ſaide vnto thee, why ſtandeſt thou all the day idle? much leſſe it becommeth thee to bee either found diſſolute through pleaſures; or effeminated with pompe and ſtate. The will of the teſtator giues thee none of theſe. But what? If thou bee contented with that which is conteined in them, haue a more care of the inheritance and of the worke, then of glorie and riches: For what did the holie Apoſtle leaue thee, that which I haue, ſayth he, I giue thee. And what is that? not gold nor ſiluer, when as he had none of that, but what? care ouer the Church. But what did he leaue thee? a Lordſhippe. Heare what hee ſayeth,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:25632:138"/> not ruling as Lords ouer the Lords inheritance, but being made a paterne of the flocke. And that thou mayſt know that theſe things are ſo in deede, Chriſt ſayth in the Goſpell. The kings raigne ouer the nations: but you ſhall not do ſo. Of theſe it is plaine that Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are forbidden the Apoſtles, the which whoſoeuer doe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelues, are of the number of them of whom God complaines thus: They haue raigned but not by me. And after: they are the miniſters of Chriſt, and ſo am I, and hee addeth, I ſpeake as vnwiſe, I more, being in many labours. O excellent miniſterie: if thou muſt glorie let the patterne of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles be ſet before thine eies, acknowledge thine inheritance in Chriſts croſſe, in many labours: happie is hee that can ſaye, I haue laboured more then they all. Thus farre <hi>Bernard:</hi> let them marke well this</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus) <hi>that glorie in their authoritie. To</hi> Peter <hi>therefore were the keies giuen, but as to a miniſter.</hi>
                        </hi> This <hi>Ferus</hi> alledgeth out of <hi>Bernard</hi> to beate downe the Popes idle pompe and pride: and to extoll the excellencie of the miniſterie of the goſpell. The name whereof nowe to be called a miniſter. the catholikes cannot abide. All this ſentence of <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Ferus,</hi> haue they of Rome in their edition left quite out: they like not that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould receiue the keies as a miniſter, that he ſhould be matched with other paſtors, as he both ioineth himſelfe,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. Gal. 2, 9.</note> and <hi>Paule</hi> ioineth him. They like not that <hi>Bernard</hi> giueth him not a Lordſhippe or dominion ouer Chriſts Church, which Chriſt onelie challengeth to himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn</hi> 23.3.</note> I am ſayth he your Lord and maiſter: but a miniſterie or ſeruice, and therefore impaires his authoritie: that he ſhould not be Chriſts vicegerent here on earth. <hi>Ferus</hi> repeates that twiſe that to <hi>Peter</hi> were the keies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but as to a miniſter. This they leaue out in both places; It pleaſeth them not that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be a miniſter. <hi>Thirdly that is alſo to be marked ſayth <hi>Ferus,</hi> that it is expreſly ſayd, I will giue thee the keies of the kingdome of heauen: hee doth not ſay of the kingdome of the earth. Theſe wordes belong nothing to earthlie iuriſdiction, which notwithſtanding they goe about to eſtabliſh on theſe words, affirming that <hi>Peter</hi> not onely in ſpirituall, but alſo in externall and worldly affaires to haue receiued fulneſſe of authoritie.</hi>

                        </hi> and if <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were the Apoſtles he conferred with; ſo alſo was <hi>Peter</hi> no doubt, the Apoſtle he after reproued: nay hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Peter</hi> alſo <hi>Cephas,</hi> by both his names, leſt hee ſhould ſeeme to forget the priuiledge giuen him of our ſauiour.

                     <p>But this their expoſition is not onely againſt the ſcripture: but alſo againſt the Fathers. <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hadde ſoone béen agréede, if they had credited any ſuch matter, who ſo earneſtly wrote one againſt the other,<note place="margin">Aug. epiſt. <hi>9.</hi>

This diuerſitie of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:25632:140"/> copies, argues ſome of Sathans ſubtilties. And here may bee a true and forcible argument drawne, againſt the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie: If <hi>Peter</hi> had béen head of the Church, hee ought not ſo publiquely &amp; ſharply to haue béen reproued of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pintus:</hi> but as <hi>Gagneus</hi> and <hi>Auſten</hi> and almoſt all the auncient fathers, and truth it ſelfe, doth witneſſe <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo openly and ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue him; therefore he was not head of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> how reſolute he is in this his opinion, concerning the Popes authoritie, it is worth the marking: howe plainly in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his workes, as occaſion offers, hee ſhewes his iudgment herein: <hi>If therefore</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>wee will haue the Church ſafe, let vs eſpecially pray for the holy ghoſt: for it is he wherein the Church is vnited, gouerned, ſpread abroad and preſerued. He alone is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tutor, gouernour, teacher, and comforter of all the faithfull.</hi> To the vnitie of the church, as other papiſts doe, hee requires not the vnitie of a miniſteriall head, to gouerne the church, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the holy ſpirit. And after ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> he writes thus: <hi>He ſtood in the midſt of his brethren. In which word the humilitie of <hi>Peter</hi> is commended. For he did not alone by himſelfe puft vp with vaine arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie diſpoſe the eccleſiaſticall affaires, according to his owne pleaſure: but in the midſt of his brethren he diſpatched all thinges, which were to be done. For it is not lawfull that the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall affaires, and what thinges belong to the whole Church, ſhould bee ordered by the pleaſures of a fewe: but rather that thoſe thinges ſhould be diſpoſed to the glorie of God, according to the rules and appointment of the ſcriptures, by the mutuall conſent of good men. Neither is that fit that any one ſhall take vpon him any office whatſoeuer. For the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Let all things be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and according to order.</hi>
                        </hi> Therefore it was neceſſarie, that one of the Apoſtles ſhould orderly doe thoſe neceſſarie affaires: and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſtepps forth who had béen euer hitherto both more zelous, and more apt, and luckie in diſpatching buſineſſes. <hi>Peter</hi> alone like the Pope, preſumptuouſly dealt not in eccleſiaſticall affaires. And after ſpeaking of <hi>Peter: Hee calles them brethren, though he were the firſt in order amongſt the Apoſtles. For others are not to be diſdained becauſe of our higher eſtate aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he begins his oration of the holy ſcrip u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:25632:141"/> to doe? Therefore let ciuill matters be diſcuſſed by ciuill, iuſt, and equall lawes: And thoſe things which are diuine, let them be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance of the ſcriptures. For there ought nothing to bee eſtabliſhed, or decreede in the Church, but firſt of all wee ſhould aſke cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell of the holy ſcriptures. The which thing I would to God had been obſerued till now: but now that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly put in practiſe of many: So I wil haue it: This I command to be done: my pleaſure is a ſufficient warrant.</hi> Surely <hi>Ferus</hi> in theſe words toucheth the Popes peremptorie authoritie. And after vpon theſe wordes: <hi>Let another take his Biſhopricke, <hi>he calls his biſhopprick, his Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical office or functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not an empire or a Lordſhip. And not without cauſe: for they expound a Biſhoppricke to be a watching, or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeeing; the which is the proper office of the Apoſtles.</hi>
                        </hi> But the Pope will not onely haue an Empire, but be aboue Emperors. And after. <hi>But what conſtant and true witneſſes needs Ieſus Chriſt? He that is one of Chriſts witneſſes needs not to the execution of his office an externall ſword, &amp; weapons, but rather a readie and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed toung, by which he may do &amp; exerciſe faithfully the charg com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him. For it is the dutie of an Apoſtle, to excell in tongue, &amp; worde.</hi> And againe, <hi>The authoritie of the chriſtian faith is great, which is declared to vs of witneſſes, which haue declared vnto vs not onely thinges heard; but thinges ſeene and moſt aſſured. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the chiefe amongſt the Apoſtles, haue witneſſed this vnto vs moſt aſſuredly.</hi> Here wee maie note how he ioines <hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Peter,</hi> as two principall or chiefe amongſt the reſt of the Apoſtles. If <hi>Peter</hi> had had this prerogatiue to him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alone of our ſauiour, <hi>Ferus</hi> had done him wronge, to haue ioined <hi>Iohn</hi> with him in this primacie. And againe: Speaking of the election of <hi>Matthias, <hi>none of theſe although now verie skilful in the goſpell by himſelfe, cares for, procures or goes about this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but being all called together without preferring themſelues, or diſdaining one of the other; they all waite for indifferently the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the holy ghoſt.</hi>

For hee knewe wel enough that he exerciſed the office not of a Lord or maiſter, but of a ſeruant of the Church. The Church is the ſpouſe of Chriſt; and ſhe is the Ladie of the houſe: <hi>Peter</hi> is but a ſeruant and miniſter. The Church therefore hath authoritie not onely to aske accompt of her ſeruants; but alſo if they bee not fitte, quite to put them away. So heretofore it hath been often done in generall councels. But nowe wicked Biſhoppes will not be reproued nor rulde by the Church: as though they were Lordes and not ſeruantes. Therefore by the iuſt iudgment of God, they are deſpiſed of all men.

                        <hi>By this worde therefore Chriſt doth bridle all the pride and ambition of eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for admitte whoſoeuer they be, whether Popes or Biſhoppes, or Cardinals, or Doctours, what are they elſe but ſeruants? And if they be ſeruants (as no man will denie) they ought to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo, as that they ſhould not climbe aboue their maiſter: howe this is done among them, let them looke to it. For here is not a place (as we ſaie) to rake in this filthie fenne or lake. Their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will tell them, in what thinges they are vnlike to Chriſt: nay wherein they endeuour to climbe vp aboue Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Here <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is loth to meddle with the Popes pride, as ſhould ſéeme: but for all that, hee glaunceth at it, and giues him, as wee ſaie, an Item.</p>
                     <p>And a little after he diſcouers ſome parts of this pride. <hi>In worldly affaires no man dare preferre himſelfe before his maiſter, or will ſeeke to take more eaſe then his maiſter doth: but in ſpirituall matters we ſee it farre otherwiſe. There is no man but coueteth and wiſheth to be in better eſtate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt was in, Chriſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was in the ſhape of God hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled himſelfe: we vile wretches ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide humilitie. Chriſt miniſtred to vs, who were his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: we thinke ſcorne to miniſter or do ſeruice to any. Chriſt did good euen to the ſimpleſt: we thinke much to do good euen to our brethren. Chriſt laboured &amp; tooke paines: we ſeeke our owne eaſe. Chriſt although hee were the brightnes of his fathers glorie: yet patiently endured the reproches of men; we are of a contrarie minde. Chriſt being the iudge of all men; notwithſtanding ſuffered himſelfe to bee iudged: we diſdaine to be iudged or reproued of any. Chriſt by the croſſe and death entred into his glorie: we thinke to come thither, by riot and pleaſure. What therefore doe we elſe, but preferre our ſelues before our maiſter, and deſire a better eſtate then hee had? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without cauſe he vrgeth this word ſo often, &amp; ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto vs: He will haue vs knowe that we are ſeruants. Againe, that we ſhould conſider what he hath done and ſuffered: he that markes this diligently will bee moſt readie to doe all good, and moſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to endure all euill.</hi> He ſéemes here alſo to glaunce at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes pride and pompe. Againe, howe <hi>Peter</hi> was chiefe amonge the Apoſtles, he writes thus, of the waſhing of the Apoſtles féete: <hi>It is moſt likelie that he began at <hi>Peter,</hi> who was the firſt or chiefe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:25632:144"/> amonge the Apoſtles, not in calling; for <hi>Andrew</hi> followed Chriſt before him: but in the election of the Apoſtleſhippe, for there <hi>Peter</hi> is placed in the firſt place, &amp;c.</hi> So that by <hi>Ferus</hi> his iudgment, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was the chiefe among the Apoſtles, becauſe when as Chriſt choſe his xij. Apoſtles, he firſt choſe <hi>Peter:</hi> he was the firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the firſt choſen of the twelue.</p>
                     <p>And againe, that the Pope ought not to haue both ſwords,<note place="margin">Fer.

Awaye with thy ſworde which kills men: my ſworde which I haue committed vnto thee cuts off vices; but ſaues men. Therefore put thou that materiall ſworde into thy ſheath againe, or as the other Euangeliſts ſaide, into his owne place. The proper place of the materiall ſworde, is the ordinarie power, that is, the ciuill magiſtrate. Put thy ſword therfore into that ſheath: let the ciuill magiſtrate vſe it, and not thou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this place as in manie other places alledged in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; <hi>Ferus</hi> plainlie teacheth that the Pope ought not to haue both ſwords, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> had them not: and therefore he quite ouerthrowes the Popes ſupremacie. This is the very foundation thereof: that the Pope hath the right of both the ſwordes. And after: <hi>Againe he teacheth by this worde, that the goſpell is not to be defended with worldly weapons; nor with mans ayde: but the defence thereof is to be committed to God. So ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our warfare are not carnall: ſo Chriſt neuer vſed any ſword; nor his Apoſtles are euer read to haue been girded with ſwordes. They taught the word: and the word it ſelfe fought with his owne power: And the Apoſtles went euer away conquerors. So Chriſt in <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, I will giue you a mouth and wiſdome, which your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall not be able to reſiſt. Therefore Chriſt, eſpecially by this word, forbiddes his Apoſtles the externall ſword: for they haue, and they ought to haue the ſworde of the ſpirite, which is the worde of God. And hence <hi>Eſay</hi> propheſieth; that the battell of the Apoſtles ſhalbe as in the day of <hi>Madian,</hi> that is, as <hi>Gedeon</hi> ouercame the <hi>Madianits,</hi> not with weapons, but with trumpets and breaking of pitchers: ſo ſhould the Apoſtles do ſpiritually, that they ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the whole world to Chriſt, by the trumpet of the word of God, and by ſuffering afflictions, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here alſo <hi>Ferus</hi> plainly teacheth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the goſpel muſt not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with armes and ſwords, with fire and fagotte, as the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:25632:145"/> Pope ſéeke nowe to maintaine his kingdome. And <hi>Ferus</hi> of Chriſts kingdome,<note place="margin">Part 3. paſſ.</note> writes thus: <hi>My kingdome is otherwiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned then a warlike kingdome: for this is gouerned with a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſword, but my kingdome ſtands in no neede of that ſword, for the ſword thereof is the word of God. The kingdome of the world hath Cities, Caſtles, Townes, Villages, Armes, Weapons: but my kingdome only requires the hearts of men. The world raignes ouer mens bodies and goods: but I ouer mens hearts &amp; conſciences. The world raignes with fleſhly power, but it obeyes the ſpirituall power; but I make no accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of fleſhly power, but I raign ſpiritually againſt fin, death, and hell, &amp;c.</hi> The Popes kingdome is far vnlike this.</p>
                     <p>And of Chriſts crowne of thornes he writes thus: <hi>The crownes of the kinges of this world,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fer. part 3. paſſ</note> 
                        <hi>are ſome of iron, ſome of ſiluer ſome of golde. By which is declared, that the kingdome of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of fleſhly power, glorie and nobilitie. But Chriſts crowne is a crowne of thornes; that by this token thou maieſt knowe that Chriſtes kingdome conſiſts of thornes and afflictions. And what kinde of king Chriſt is himſelfe, ſuch like kings he makes vs, that is, ſubiect to afflictions:</hi> No doubt then the Pope was neuer made king by Chriſt: he is farre vnlike him, as hee was here in this world.

When as againe after their anſwere, he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of them againe: <hi>But whom doe you ſaie that I am?</hi> as the principall and head of the reſt, he firſt cried out: <hi>Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God,</hi> He alſo ſmote off <hi>Malchas</hi> eare, thinking by this meanes that he ſhould euer cleaue to his maiſter. Therefore of good right Chriſt asked him if he loued him more then the reſt, and that thrice. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo confeſſed that he loued him, and he calles none other to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this his loue, but Chriſt himſelfe. And in euery one of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions the words being a little altered, he heard that he muſt haue a care of Chriſts ſheepe.

                           </gap>gher matter: for becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> with the reſt was adorned by Chriſt with the name of an Apoſtle, and he denied him thrice at his paſſion: by good right now the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of his three-folde loue is required, that his three fold deniall might be requited with the like nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. So that which was committed by words, was cured with words. He asked of him if he loued him more then the reſt: for he which had tried the greater cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of his maiſter towards him, by good right ought to haue loued him more. And although all the Apoſtles generally were ſtricken with great feare, when the Lorde was betrayed: yet <hi>Peters</hi> fault was the greateſt, that in ſo ſhort a time denied him thrice. Therfore ſeeing by the mercie of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our he obtained forgiuenes of a great ſinne, iuſtly of him greater loue is required. All paſtors of the Church hereby learne: that they can no otherwiſe be beloued of Chriſt, then if ſo bee that they ſhal ſtudie with al their maine &amp; might, that his ſheep be wel fed, &amp; like well. Such a one was <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</hi> He proues that <hi>Peter</hi> had his Apoſtleſhip common with the reſt of the Apoſtles, &amp; that by this place it was reſtored him againe, and no primacie granted him ouer all the church: And that all doctors heere haue receiued a charge, not <hi>Peter</hi> onely: He concludes thus. <hi>By <hi>Peters</hi> threefold confeſſion, his three folde ſinne of denying is done away. And hee ſayde to him; feede my Lambes: reſtoring to him againe the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his Apoſtleſhippe, leaſt through his deniall which chanced by mans frailtie, it had ſeemed to haue beene diſanulled.</hi> Héere is a reſtitution of <hi>Peter:</hi> heere is no prelation, as the Papiſts
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:25632:146"/> teach, of the ſupremacie. <hi>Ierome</hi> writes thus: <hi>The arke of <hi>Noah</hi> was a figure of the Church;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierom. contra lucifera nos.</note> 
                        <hi>as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>In the arke of</hi> Noah <hi>a fewe,</hi> that is, <hi>eight ſoules were ſaued by water; As now alſo baptiſme ſaueth vs.</hi> As in that were all kinde of beaſts; ſo in this are men of all countries and conditions. The arke had her neſts: ſo the Church her manſions. Eight ſoules of men were ſaued in the arke: and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes biddes vs giue part to ſeuen, and part to eight; that is, beleeue both the teſtaments. And therefore ſome pſalmes are written for the eight; and by eight verſes, which are put vnder euery letter. And in the 118. pſalme the iuſt man is inſtructed: and the bleſſings by the which the Lorde ſignifieth his Church in the mount, are eyght, &amp;c. A Crowe is ſent out of the arke, and returneth no more; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Doue ſheweth the peace of the earth: So in the baptiſme of the Church, that blacke birde being expelled, that is, the Diuell, the Doue of the holy ghoſt declareth the peace of our lande. The arke beginning of 30. cubits is built, by little and little decreaſing into one cubite: So likewiſe the Church conſiſting of many degrees, at length is finiſhed with Deacons, Prieſts, and Biſhops.</hi> Héere wee maye plainly ſée that <hi>Ierome</hi> makes the whole order and brotherhood of Biſhopps, to bee that one cubite, in which the arke was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and not anie one Biſhop, no not the Biſhoppe of Rome. For in the ſame booke he alleadgeth thus <hi>Cyprian,</hi> writing to the Biſhop of Rome: <hi>He ends</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his diſcourſe which hee had made to <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of Rome after this manner: We haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed theſe things to your conſcience (moſt welbeloued brother) both for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon honour, and for my ſincere loue I beare vnto you, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that thoſe things pleaſe you for the truth of your faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which are both true and religious. But wee knowe ſome that will hardly refuſe that which they haue once taſted; nor chang their reſolution eaſily: but the knotte of peace and concorde, being kept ſafe among their fellow Biſhops, wil keepe ſome priuate opinions to themſelues, which they haue once liked of. Wherein wee will not vrge nor preſcribe a lawe to any man, when as euery one in the Church hath free power and authoritie to gouerne, as he will; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is ſet ouer the Lords flocke, beeing to giue account to the Lord of his doing.</hi> Here is plaine by <hi>Cyprians</hi> and <hi>Ieromes</hi> iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the common honour of all Biſhoppes, that one of them cannot enforce another: And that they haue euery one of them frée power of gouernment in their ſeuerall charges, whereof they are
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:25632:146"/> to giue accompt to the Lord. And of the authoritie and neceſſitie of Biſhops he writes thus in the ſame booke: <hi>If at the praier only of the Biſhop, the holy ghoſt deſcended; then they are in a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caſe, who beeing baptized by prieſts and Deacons in villages, townes &amp; far diſtant places, haue died before euer they were viſited of the Biſhops. The health of the Church conſiſteth in the dignitie &amp; reuerence of the chiefe prieſts, to whom if a peereles &amp; chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie be giuen of all men, there will bee ſo manye ſchiſmes in the Church, as there<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi> Héere wee may plainly ſee firſt, the iuriſdiction of Biſhops ouer manie villages and countrey townes, in which onelie Prieſts and Deacons were placed, in <hi>Ieromes</hi> daies: And that euen then, as ſome now a daies thinke, euerie paſtor was not a Biſhop in his flocke. Secondlie, what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of euerie Biſhop was, it was <hi>Exors,</hi> it was péereleſſe, he had none aboue him in this world in his charge; noe, not the Biſhoppe of Rome. And laſtlie, that whereas M. <hi>Dorman</hi> in his booke againſt M. <hi>Nowell,</hi> doth alleage this place to proue the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Romes authoritie, and would proue that <hi>S. Ierome</hi> in this place ment him, <hi>Marianus Victorinus Reatinus Epiſcopus,</hi> who hath corrected <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> workes and newly imprinted them, being a great Papiſt, affirmes, that this place is ment of euery Biſhoppe in his Dioceſſe. <hi>Hee calles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Biſhoppe the chiefe prieſt; whoſe authoritie alſo to be greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other prieſts, hee doth otherwhere plainly and manifeſtly auouch. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles whoſe roome the Biſhops now occupie, &amp; ſucceede in, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the 72 diſciples, whom as bleſſed <hi>Damaſus</hi> the Prieſt doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the Prieſts do now ſucceede. So <hi>Aaron</hi> and the other hie prieſts, were euer aboue the Leuites.</hi> So that by his iudgment, by this chiefe prieſt is not ment the Pope, but euerie Biſhop: And that euerie Biſhops authority is péereles. And this vnitie of Biſhops makes <hi>Ierome</hi> to be the vnitie of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes thus: <hi>The ſcribes and Phariſees ſitte vpon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> chaire, doe what they ſay: <hi>but doe not as they doe. You ſee that in the chaire of</hi> Moyſes, <hi>to which hath nowe ſucceeded the chaire of Chriſt, that alſo euill men doe ſitte, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the good thinges which they are about to teach, doe not hurt their hearers. Wherefore doeſt thou for the wicked mens ſake, forſake the chaire? Returne againe to peace, returne againe to vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which hurt thee not. If I ſpeake well, and doe well, followe me: But if I doe not as I ſay; thou heareſt the counſell of the Lorde;</hi>
                           <pb n="268" facs="tcp:25632:147"/> Doe what I ſay; but what I doe, doe thou not. <hi>But yet depart not from the catholique chaire.</hi>
                        </hi> Héere we may ſée that this chaire of Chriſt was in euerie countrey, and that euery Biſhop ſate in it, not the Biſhop of Rome onelie. <hi>Auſten</hi> himſelfe ſate in it, and to the vnitie of the chaire he exhorts ſchiſmatikes, that they would returne. Secondly we may note, howe this chaire then was called, <hi>Chriſts chaire,</hi> not <hi>Peters chaire;</hi> As the Pope nowe calles his.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſtrickt vnitie that is betwixt Chriſt the head and his Church y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie,<note place="margin">Aug. in pſal. 37.</note> he writes thus: <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Chriſt ſpeaketh, ſomtime he ſpeaketh in the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the only head, becauſe he is a ſauiour borne of the Virgin <hi>Marie;</hi> ſometime in the perſon of his bodie, which is the whole church, diſperſed through the whole world. And we are in his bodie, if our faith be pure, our hope ſure, and our loue inflamed.</hi> And after where hee ſaith: <hi>The wordes of my ſinnes; there is no doubt but that it is the voice of Chriſt. But how come ſinnes, but of his bodie which is the Church? becauſe both the bodie of Chriſt and the head ſpeakes. Why ſpeakes he alone? becauſe they ſhal be two in one fleſh. This is a great myſterie (ſaith the Apoſtle) I meane of Chriſt and of his Church.</hi> And a little after, <hi>If he hath ſayd: now they are not two, but one fleſh; what maruaile is it, if one fleſh and one tounge vtter the ſame words, as of one fleſh, one head, and of one bodie? let vs heare them as one; but yet the head as the heade, and the bodie as the bodie. The perſonnes are not deuided, but there is a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their dignities; becauſe the head doth ſaue, the body is ſaued: The head ſhewes mercie, the body bewailes her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie: the head is to purge ſinnes, the bodie to confeſſe ſinnes: and yet one voice of them both.</hi> Héere we may ſée the narrowe vnion betwéene Chriſt and his Church. They are one fleſh: hee is an adulterer that intrudes himſelfe betwéene theſe. The Church ſinneth, euen the Pope himſelfe, if he be a member of this body, by <hi>Auguſtines</hi> iudgment; and the head alone ſaueth: Chriſt alone is the head; and all the reſt are members.</p>

What can be plainer then this? Shall wee not beleeue <hi>Auſten?</hi> And in another place of the foundations and bulwarks of the Church, he writes thus:<note place="margin">Epiſt. 56.</note> 
                        <hi>Heretiques goe about to vndermine, or ouercome the moſt ſure foundations of the Church by the ſhew of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that mercifull Captaine of our faith, hath as it were with a moſt ſtronge tower defended his Church, by the ſolemne aſſemblies of all nations &amp; people, by the ſeats of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and by certaine excellent learned, godly and ſpirituall men, &amp; alſo he hath fenced it with the plentifull furniture of inuincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Theſe are all the viſible bulwarks and towers of defence of the Church, which <hi>S. Auſten</hi> knewe in his daies. Firſt generall councells: then the apoſtolicall ſeas (no one apoſtolicall ſea more then the reſt, no not Rome) and laſtly ſome eſpeciall godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, with their inuincible arguments and forces of reaſon. Where alſo we maie note: that as he preferreth no one apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſea before all the reſt, ſo that he doth preferre generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels before them all. So that by <hi>Auguſtines</hi> iudgment a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councell is to be preferred before the Church of Rome. And here <hi>Auguſtine</hi> declaring the bulwarks of Gods Church againſt heretiques, had ſhewed himſelfe to be a verie vnſkilfull Captain of the Lords armie, if ſo be that he had quite forgotten the chiefe bulwarke aboue all the reſt againſt them, that is, that the Pope cannot erre. This had been the forcibleſt bulwarke that the Church could haue had againſt all heretiques. But <hi>Auſten</hi> in his daies knewe no ſuch, and therefore no doubt hee makes no mention of it.</p>
                     <p>And alſo in another place of <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiue, he writes thus: <hi>As ſome things are ſayd which ſeeme properly to belong to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe: and yet they are not rightly expounded,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In pſal. 108.</note> 
                        <hi>vnleſſe they be referred to the Church, of which hee is acknowledged in a type to haue borne the figure, for the primacie that hee had among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: As this, To thee I will giue the keies of the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:25632:148"/> and other ſpeeches of our ſauiour to him like to this; ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> likewiſe as it were ſuſtaineth the perſon of the Iewes, that bee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto Chriſt: which then hated Chriſt, and now alſo their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes continuing, as it were by a ſucceſſion doe hate him ſtill.</hi> Here <hi>Auſten</hi> acknowledgeth a primacie of <hi>Peter</hi> amongſt the Apoſtles. But for all that by this his primacie by <hi>Auſtens</hi> iudgement, hee gaineth nothing to his ſucceſſor, or to the Biſhop of Rome: but to the whole Church, whoſe Image he ſuſtained becauſe he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe among the Apoſtles. He plainly affirmes: that <hi>Peter</hi> was a type of the whole Church, &amp; to it conueyed that priuiledge giuen to him; and not to his ſucceſſor the Biſhop of Rome, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> papiſts now would haue him. And to expound that ſaying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: To thée will I giue the keies of the kingdom of heauen, (as the papiſts doe nowe) to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, is not rightlie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them, what can be plainer then? As <hi>Iudas</hi> ſuſtaineth the perſons of all the wicked Iewes, ſo doth <hi>Peter</hi> not of the biſhop of Rome, but of the whole Church.

                        <hi>which he calls by their names, and to whom alſo he writes his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: Not that they were the principall Churches of all other; but that which hee ſpeakes to one hee ſpeakes to all: for there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as when one doth preferre the ſtanderd of a fewe ſouldiers to a greater number. <hi>Paul</hi> taught firſt, that all the churches of the world were but ſeuen, and thoſe ſeuen, which he named, to be that one ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church. The which thing that he might obſerue him ſelfe, he exceeded not the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſeuen Churches: but he wrote to the Romanes, Corinthians, Galathians, Epheſians, Philippians, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and to the Theſſalonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And afterward he wrote to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, leaſt he ſhould exceede the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſeauen Churches. And briefly knitting vp togither the whole ſumme of his preaching he ſaith to <hi>Timothie.</hi> That thou maiſt know how thou oughteſt to behaue thy ſelfe in the Church of the liuing God. We read alſo that this type was declared by the holy Ghoſt, by the prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> of ſeuen women, that ſhould lay hould of one man. Chriſt is that one man, which was not borne of mans ſeede: the ſeuen women are the churches, taking their bread, and with them (that is their garments) they are couered, who deſire that their reproch may bee taken from them, and that the name of the Lord may be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. They take their bread, which is the holy Ghoſt, which nouriſheth into his eternal life, promiſed them by faith, and their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo, which are promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which deſire that they may be clothed. Of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, this mortalitie muſt be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortalitie. And they deſire that their reproch may be taken away: their reproch is their old accuſtomed ſinne, which is taken away in baptiſme, and a man then beginnes to be called a Chriſtian: which is as much to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:25632:149"/> ſay, as let thy name be called vpon. Therefore in theſe ſeuen chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it may be that of one Church is made ſeuen, &amp;c.

And as Chriſt which is the head of the church, was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt; ſo the holy Church which is his bodie, is filled with the ſame holy ſpirit, that it may liue: and by his power is ſtrengthned, that it may ſtand in the ioining or coupling togither of one faith and charitie. By which the whole bodie being miniſtred vnto &amp; built by ioints and couplings, growes to the increaſe of God.

The holie ſpirit then is the gouernour, and guardian of Chriſts Church here on earth: wee are not orphanes.

                     <p>All the Apoſtles likewiſe attribute this power and authority to the holie Ghoſt: In that great controuerſie about circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obſeruing the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                     <p>And as the holie Ghoſt did then expreſlie ſhew his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the beginning; ſo no doubt, by his moſt mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſecret inſpiration, he gouernes the ſame ſtill: and as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles acknowledge him the gouernour of the church, &amp; no one of them; but him as the head commanding works &amp; placing miniſters, and deciding controuerſies, and themſelues all as hands and féete, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> makes them; fulfilling his will</p>

To abhorre, is to execrate, to loath, to diſdaine, not to ſuffer; to throw a thinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with diſdaine or indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hence an abomination or a thing abominable that is called, which engenders an abhorring, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or deteſtation: But no outward vncleannes God doth loath, but our ſinnes. Hereof verie often, and for the moſt part, they are called abominations in the ſcripture, as for example: The way of the vngodly is abomination vnto the Lord; but the greateſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all other in the ſcriptures, is Idolatrie, impietie, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and falling away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. Therfore after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, Chriſt doth ſaie, that there ſhalbe abomination in the Church, that is, an apoſtacie or departing from God; And that not any meane depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or falling away; but ſuch a one as ſhall bring deſolation with it: that is, ſhall vtterlie goe about to ouerthrow chriſtian religion. And this abomination, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> meanes in the Reuelation, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by the beaſt, to which the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath giuen his power; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by the woman ſitting on the beaſt and making all Nations drunken of the wine of her fornication. Of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh more plainely, vnleſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a departing come firſt &amp; that, that man of ſinne be reueiled, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore this abomination is nothing elſe, then the kingdome and tyrannie of Antichriſt, or the falling away from god, which ſhalbe vnder his kingdom. And ſée how euidentlie, in theſe fewe wordes hee deſcribes this kingdome of Antichriſt: firſt, <hi>It ſhalbe nothing elſe but an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> Secondly, <hi>it ſhall make a deſolation of true faith and religion.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>it ſhall ſitte in the Church.</hi> This abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall reſt in the hearts of men, that externally they ſhall ſéeme the temples of God: but inwardly in ſtead of Chriſt, an Idoll ſhall ſit: That is, this abomination ſhall poliſh it ſelfe, with a faire ſhew; that it ſhall be able to beguile the ſaints, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were by Gods power preſerued.</p>
                     <p>What can be more manifeſtlie ſayde then this? that there ſhalbe in the Church of Chriſt ſuch an abomination, that ſhall quite ouerthrow all true religion; and ſhall poliſh it ſelfe with a great ſhew of holines? Doth not this plainly paint out pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:25632:152"/> who will venter the health of his ſoule vpon the name of the Church, wherein his abomination ſhall reſt, and that with ſuch a great ſhew of holines? But he goes forward: <hi>When you ſhall ſee the abomination, that is, when that ſonne of perdition ſhall make himſelfe manifeſt, <hi>(For he ſhalbee made manifeſt.)</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his kingdome begun by and by in the Apoſtles time, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now the myſterie of iniquitie worketh:</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith. <hi>Now there are many Antichriſtes:</hi> yea euen as Chriſts kingdome began from that iuſt <hi>Abell;</hi> ſo the kingdome of Antichriſt, from that wicked <hi>Caine</hi> yet in the end of the world, that impietie ſhall manifeſtly diſcouer it ſelfe: and of this Chriſt here puts vs in minde. <hi>And Chriſt hath added: He that readeth let him vnderſtand:</hi> By which word he giues vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that that abomination &amp; apoſtaſie ſhall creepe in ſo ſecretly, that none vnleſſe he be verie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue &amp; watchfull, ſhalbe able to perceiue the ſame. The which is moſt worthie of marking, otherwiſe the ſame thing ſhall happen to vs with Antichriſt, as befell to the Iewes, with the true Chriſt: for they onely looked for in Chriſt promiſed an earthlie kingdome, worldlie iuriſdiction and peace: This they gaped after, and do as yet gape for. In the meane while, they knew not Chriſt being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned him, as a wicked man to death: who, if they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared Chriſts doctrine &amp; miracles to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, might eaſilie haue knowne him. So it falles out, for the moſt part with vs; we marke onely thoſe thinges which are externally ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichriſt, which as long as we ſee not, we liue careleſſe. And in the mean time, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marks that this abomination, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things is fulfilled dayly, which one ſhall eaſilie perceiue, that compareth Chriſts doctrine to our times. Marke therefore, that as Chriſt came firſt ſecretly; ſo that he was knowne, but of a few, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it appeare who he was, before that he had ouercome the Diuell and Death; but theſe being ouercome, when as he raigned, then at laſt, he appeared to the world, by the preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; <hi>All power</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is giuen to mee, goe yee therefore and teach, &amp;c.</hi> So the kingdome of Antichriſt enters in ſecretly; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall it be perceiued, till he hath gotten poſſeſſion of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then ſhall Antichriſt himſelfe appeare. To conclude, if Chriſt at the firſt had ſhewed who he had been, all men would haue receiued him: So the Deuill, if in the beginning, hee ſhould haue ſhewed his wickedneſſe manifeſtly, all would haue fled from him.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:25632:152"/> Againe, as Chriſts kingdome began, before hee appeared in the fleſh; for all the elect from <hi>Abel,</hi> euen to the worlds ende, belong to the kingdome of Chriſt, and are one bodie with him: So Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome began before he appeared himſelfe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the myſterie of iniquity worketh, which ſhalbe reueiled in his time: yea all the wicked from <hi>Cain,</hi> euen to the laſt of them, doe belong to the kingdome of Antichriſt, &amp; are one bodie with him. Let euery bodie nowe conſider himſelfe, and ſearch the Temple of his hart leaſt peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture he find any thing of Antichriſts kingdom &amp; abomination, that is of Idolatrie in himſelfe. Which that thou maiſt the better doe: Take with thee the firſt commaundement, wherein wee are taught, to haue but one God. If thou findeſt any thing in thy ſelfe, wherein thou truſteſt, beſides God, whether it be any externall thing, as to truſt in thine owne righteouſnes and merits, now thou haſt that abomination in thy heart and that true Antichriſt: For Chriſt teacheth contrarie thinges. If thou heareſt or ſeeſt any thing in the Church, which is repugnant to the doctrine of Chriſt &amp; to his life, that truly belonges to the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: for this is a true ſaying, <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> And ſecondlie here we may not, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall come in cloſelie and priuilie, that he ſhall poſſeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple, that is the heart of man; and that the onelie way to diſcouer him, is by the ſcriptures; that all doctrines contrarye to them are Antichriſtian: And that this is a principall braunch of antichriſtian doctrine (to taſte of one for all) to truſt in our owne merits, or righteouſnes. And is not this moſt euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to affirme, that the Church of Rome is the ſeate of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, who hath taught, and doth teach this doctrine?</p>
                     <p>Againe vpon theſe wordes; <hi>Behold here is Chriſt, or there, <hi>Ferus</hi>
                        </hi> writes thus: <hi>Doe the falſe prophets preach Chriſt? yea vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: for to preach Chriſt, is to preach righteouſnes, ſanctification, forgiuenes of ſinnes, and redemption. For Chriſt is become al theſe thinges vnto vs. And theſe thinges the falſe Prophets preach, how we may obtaine righteouſnes and redemption: But they teach not that we muſt looke for and ſeeke theſe thinges onely from Chriſt, and onely by Chriſt. Yea they neglecting Chriſt, doe teach to ſeeke for righteouſnes and forgiuenes of ſinnes in other thinges: Behold ſay they: here or there is Chriſt, which in deede is to ſeduce, and leade out of the way. For theſe thinges are founde no where elſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:25632:153"/> but in Chriſt. There is no other name vnder heauen, by which wee muſt be ſaued.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> If this be true, then let all the world iudge, who be falſe prophets, whether the Papiſts or wee, who teach all men to truſt onelie in Chriſt, and by his meanes onely, to ſéeke for all good thinges at Gods handes: when as they teach men to truſt in their owne works, and to hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, by the merits of their friers: which things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie are to bee founde in Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Ferus,</hi> and in nothing elſe. This doctrine <hi>Ferus</hi> taught, &amp; we teach. But the latter edition of <hi>Ferus</hi> printed at Rome, hath thus corrupted <hi>Ferus. To preach Chriſt, is to preach righteouſnes, ſanctification, remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, &amp; redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for Chriſt is become all theſe thinges vnto vs. Theſe thinges alſo the falſe prophets preach, how we ſhall obtaine righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and redemption, but they teach not vs to obtaine theſe things by Chriſt, &amp; his ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and following his ſteps: yea they neglecting theſe, do teach vs to ſeek for righteouſnes, &amp; remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, through a vaine &amp; raſh confidence. Behold</hi> (ſaie they) <hi>here &amp; there is Chriſt: The which is in truth to ſeduce: for theſe things are to be founde no where elſe, then in the Catholike Church his ſpouſe by Chriſt.</hi> Thus the Romane edition enterlaceth and addes to <hi>Ferus.</hi> They doe miſlike, that righteouſnes and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes ſhould be obtained from Chriſt, and by Chriſt: They will haue (as ſhould ſéeme) our owne workes, and their ſacraments of pardones ioyned with him, and their Church: For that they meane by the Catholique Church. This they would force <hi>Ferus</hi> to teach, which he neuer taught.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ferus</hi> in his true originall concludes this matter thus: <hi>Chriſt therefore meanes in theſe wordes, that wee ſhould hope or looke for no other Chriſt, but him, that is, that we ſhould ſeek for righteouſnes, ſaluation, remiſſion of ſinnes, of him alone; nothing regarding if the falſe prophets taught any other thinge. Secondly, of theſe wordes thou haſt taught thee that Chriſt is tyed to no place, outward ſhew, peculiar kinde of worſhippe or ſtate of men, that he ſhould be found there alone, and no where elſe; otherwiſe all men muſt be forced to goe to one place, or to be of one trade. He is not bounde to Ieruſalem nor to any other Citie, that there all men ſhould finde him: neyther that he ſhould bee founde of any other, but of him that went thither: Chriſt may be founde in euery Citie, and in euery ſtate and trade of mans life, which is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:25632:153"/> to the word of God. There are two things, to which he hath bound himſelfe, &amp; wherein he hath foretold that he may be found, that is to ſaie, his word, and his ſacraments annexed to his worde. There thou ſhalt finde Chriſt in deede, neither is hee a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that ſendeth thee thither.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> Where wee may note, that to teach men to ſéeke for righteouſnes, in any other thinge, then in Chriſt, is to looke for another Chriſt: is to denie Chriſt to becomed in the fleſh: And therefore is to be a diſciple of Antichriſt. Though they ſéeme neuer ſo much to reuerence Chriſt with their toongs, if they beleeue not with their hearts, that he is ſuch a Chriſt, as the goſpell teacheth, that he alone is our righteouſnes: they are of Antichriſt. Secondlie, if we will haue Chriſt, we muſt ſéeke him in his word: He is tyed to no place but to it. How greatlie then did they beguile our forefathers, which taught them to goe a pilgrimage, to vndertake great iournies to ſéek Chriſt at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and other places; and in the meane time negelectd and neuer regarded his word? Surelie they taught men the wrong waie to finde Chriſt, if this be true that <hi>Ferus</hi> taught; which is moſt true. No nor if Chriſt bee not tied to any one ſtate of men more, then to another: then not to their Friers (as they bragge he is) more then to anie other kinde of men. If this doctrine had been taught our forefathers, I thinke they would not haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed their landes vpon Frieries and Monaſteries, as they did. Laſtlie, whereas <hi>Ferus</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt is only tyed to his word, and ſacraments annexed to his word: the Romane editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leaues out <hi>(Annexed to his word)</hi> as though there might be ſacraments not annexed or grounded vpon the word of God: As in truth manie of their ſacraments are.</p>
                     <p>Againe, <hi>Ferus</hi> vpon theſe words <hi>(Let them that be in Iewrie flie vnto the hilles)</hi> writes thus: <hi>But whither muſt we flie? To the hils, to the higher places, <hi>As he did which ſaide, I haue lift vp mine eies vnto the hilles, from whence commeth my helpe.</hi> And alſo, <hi>In thee O Lord, haue I put my truſt, I ſhall neuer bee put to confuſion:</hi> And, <hi>I haue lift vp my ſoule vnto thee.</hi> Happie is hee that hath fled to the hilles, he ſhalbe ſafe in deede. Ferus</hi> heere by theſe hilles, meanes heauen, and that we muſt truſt onelie in God: as is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the ſcriptures he alleadgeth. The Romane edition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Wee muſt flie vnto the hilles,</hi> that is, to the Catholique
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:25632:154"/> Church And to the ſuperior places, as he did ſhal ſaid: <hi>I haue lift vp mine eies vnto the hilles, &amp;c.</hi> They would haue men truſt in their Church, as ſhould ſéeme: And ſo they abuſe both <hi>Ferus</hi> meaning, and the Scriptures he alleadgeth; which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Church, but to God alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gagneius</hi> vpon that place of <hi>S. Peter <hi>(Babylon Coelected)</hi>
                        </hi> writes: <hi>That the Greeke ſcholia, and al other interpretors doe interprete Rome to be Babylon, which he ſo calles for the confuſion of their Idols.</hi> Where we maie note firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> makes himſelfe equall with other elders, calling himſelfe <hi>Compreſbyterum,</hi> that is, <hi>a fellowe elder,</hi> in his former epiſtle. And in this his ſecond epiſtle <hi>(If Babylon be Rome)</hi> as <hi>Gagneius</hi> ſéemes to affirme, he makes it equal with other Churches, calling it <hi>Coelected,</hi> that is, equallie choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God with other Churches. And what preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue then can either <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, or the Church of Rome challeng? Secondlie, if by al interpretors iudgments, as <hi>Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neius</hi> affirmes, by Babylon Rome is vnderſtood; then no doubt this ſéemes to giue a light to <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Reuelation, foreſhewing where that Babylon ſhould be, which he ſhould prophecie of. For all the ſcriptures are as a golden chaine, one linked within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and like that ſtrange whéele <hi>Exechiel</hi> ſawe: <hi>A wheele appeared on the earth by the beaſts, hauing foure faces. The faſhion of the wheeles and their worke was like a Chriſolite;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eze. 1.15.</note> 
                        <hi>and they foure had one forme, And their faſhion and their worke was, as one wheele in another wheele.</hi> This ſtrange whéele, no doubt, repreſented the goſpell: The ſcriptures agrée altogither: <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> did meane one Babylon. And that former is Rome by <hi>Gagnei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and all interpretors iudgments: And ſurelie the ſecond alſo. Who will now then, if he doe but marke theſe two places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred togither, (for in ſcriptures one place expoundes another) looke for anie good from thence?</p>
                     <p>Againe: if <hi>Peter</hi> had béene made head of the Church, by our ſauiour; he had ſinned in not taking that power and authoritie vppon him, in debaſing himſelfe and making himſelfe equall with other paſtors.<note place="margin">In 1. cap. Luc.</note> 
                        <hi>Stella</hi> ſaith; <hi>That it is humilitie to accept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honour offered of God: And it were pride to put any let or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance vnto it.</hi> How then did not <hi>Peter</hi> here by <hi>Stella</hi> his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, offend in pride, in putting a ſtoppe or hinderance to that authoritie, which our ſauiour had giuen him; when as he makes
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:25632:154"/> himſelfe equal with other paſtors? That place of S <hi>Paul,</hi> which they alleadge for the authoritie of the Church of Rome ouer all the world: <hi>I thanke my God, thorowe Ieſus Chriſt for you all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your faith is publiſhed thorowe the whole world:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In 2. cap. Luc</note> 
                        <hi>Stella</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, <hi>That is, in manie places. Stella</hi> alſo of the obedience to the ciuill magiſtrate, writes thus: <hi>That wee are taught in this place, firſt by this fact of our Sauiour, that the authoritie of a kinge is of God, which is both worthie of honour and reuerence. So hee payde tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to the tol gatherers of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he would that tribute ſhould bee paide of <hi>Peter:</hi> and being asked whether tribute ſhould be payde to <hi>Caeſar;</hi>
                        </hi> hee anſwered: <hi>Giue to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the thinges that are <hi>Caeſars. He would be ſubiect to lawes euen from the beginning of his birth, leaſt he which ſhould bee to others an example of life, and holineſſe, ſhould trouble the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth; which alſo came to amende that was amiſſe, that he might alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that a iuſt Empire hath lawes acceptable to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while the common wealth is maintained in peace &amp; iuſtice. And for this cauſe no man ought to reſiſt the higher powers, when as Chriſt the example of humilitie would be ſubiect vnto them.</hi>
                        </hi> Thus farre <hi>Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> He excepts none from that ſubiection, and obedience, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tribute, neither Pope nor cleargie. And whereas the Papiſts ſaye that one miniſteriall head is neceſſarie for the gouernment of the Church,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in pſal. 56.</note> and that ſuch a head is the Pope; S. <hi>Auſten</hi> concerning this matter writes thus: <hi>Becauſe all Chriſt is a head, &amp; a bodie, which I doe not doubt but that you knowe well enough, our Sauiour himſelfe the head, who ſuffered vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who now after he roſe from the dead, fitteth at the right hand of his father: The Church is his bodie, not this Church or that Church, but that which is ſpred ouer the whole world; nor that onely which is among men, which now preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liue, but they alſo belonging to her, which were before vs, and thoſe alſo which ſhalbe after vs, to the worlds ende. For the whole church conſiſting of all the faithfull, becauſe all the faithfull are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, hath now that head which is now placed in heauen, which gouernes his bodie. And although hee bee ſeparated from ſight, yet hee is not ſeparated from loue: Therefore, becauſe all Chriſt is a head and his bodie, therfore in al Pſalmes, let vs ſo heare the voice of our head, as we alſo heare the voice of his bodie: For he would not ſpeake ſeuerally, becauſe he would not be ſeparated. Saying: <hi>I am with you euen vnto the ende of the world:</hi> If hee bee
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:25632:155"/> with vs, he ſpeakes in vs; he ſpeakes of vs; and hee ſpeakes by vs; becauſe we ſpeake by him. And therefore we ſpeake truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſpeake in him. For if at any time wee ſhall ſpeake in our ſelues, and of our ſelues; we ſhall continue liers.</hi> Thus far <hi>Auſten:</hi> where he ſaith plainly, that Chriſt himſelfe is a head, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Church: And that which is the chief part of a gouernor, he ſpeakes vnto it; and that not by anie one, but by all his miniſters:<note place="margin">Fer. in 14. ca. Ioh.</note> To whome hee hath promiſed, <hi>He wil be with to the end of the world.</hi> And how this gouernment is executed, that is by his holie ſpirit, <hi>Ferus</hi> verie excellentlie declares: <hi>Chriſt alwaies</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth the part of a moſt faithfull Father. For euen as a father his children being yet young, doth not onely leaue them his inheritance, and all the goods he hath, but alſo placeth Tutors and guardians ouer them, that may keepe that inheritance for his children, and may reſiſt thoſe that would iniurie them; which thing the children themſelues &amp; orphanes could not doe. So Chriſt here being not content by his teſtament to leaue vs his inheritance and his goods but moreouer he promiſeth and appointeth the holie ſpirit to be our tutor and guardian, who ſhould take vpon him the care, and guardianſhippe of his Orphanes, and ſhould in euerie court before any Iudge, King, or tyraunt, defende by his lawfull pleading, the inheritance of the father bequeathed them in his teſtament; nay written with his owne bloud: and ſhould haue a care, leaſt the children by their owne negligence ſhould loſe their inheritance:</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> Now to be appointed tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or guardian of the church; what is it elſe but to be appointed gouernour of the Church?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ieron. in 4. ca. Mal.</note>The Papiſts doe teach, that before Antichriſt, <hi>Elias</hi> in his owne perſon ſhall come. Concerning which thing, <hi>Ierome</hi> writes thus: <hi>The Iewes, and heretiques following the Iewes, before their <hi>Meſſias</hi> thinke that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come, &amp; ſhall reſtore all things: And hereupon in the Goſpell this queſtion was made to Chriſt: <hi>Why the Phariſees doe ſay, that</hi> Elias <hi>ſhall come?</hi> To whome he anſwered: Helias <hi>truly ſhall come; And if you beleeue, he is comed alreadie, by</hi> Elias <hi>meaning</hi> Iohn.</hi> Thus much <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome:</hi> Where we may note, that <hi>Ierome</hi> calles them Iewiſh heretiques, that looke for <hi>Elias:</hi> And yet the Papiſtes at this daie looke for <hi>Elias.</hi> If this had béen a point of Catholique doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, in the Church in <hi>Ieromes</hi> daies, no doubt, hee would not haue béen ignorant of it: neither would he haue called the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:25632:155"/> thereof, heretiques. So that it ſhould ſéeme, the papiſts opinion concerning Antichriſt, was comed ſince <hi>Ieroms</hi> daies: whereof this comming of <hi>Elias,</hi> is a principall braunch. And that the Papiſts are of this opinion, <hi>Gagneius</hi> writes thus: <hi>Neither in this place, a myſtical expoſition of the number,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gag. in cap. xx. Apoc.</note> 
                        <hi>can fitly be applied, when as in deede in the time of Antichriſt, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come and preach, according to the teſtimonie of <hi>Malachie,</hi> we holde for a ſuretie.</hi> Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo affirmes the ſame:<note place="margin">De Rom. pont. lib. 5. cap. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>The third demonſtration</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is drawne from the comming of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> which as yet liue; and liue to this ende, that they may oppoſe themſelues againſt Antichriſt when he commeth, and ſhould preſerue the elect in the faith of Chriſt, and at the length ſhould conuert the Iewes.</hi> Theſe are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> ſhall come.</p>
                     <p>But theſe cauſes haue no ground in the ſcripture, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effect of them ſhall not follow. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.17.</note> 
                        <hi>that the word of God is the ſword of the ſpirit;</hi> with which ſworde, no doubt, all Gods enemies, amongſt whom Antichriſt is chiefe, muſt be wounded and confounded.

                        <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.8.</note> that is, no doubt, with this ſword. And as our Sauiour Chriſt fought againſt Antichriſts father the Deuill, ſaying:<note place="margin">Luk. 4.48.</note> 
                        <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> and not ſaying, thus it is taught by tradition: ſo muſt all his ſouldiers fight againſt his ſonne, the ſonne of perdition Antichriſt himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Thus it is written:</hi> Euerie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an armed with the ſword of the ſpirit, that is with the word of God, muſt oppoſe himſelfe againſt Antichriſt. This ſword is able to confound him and cut off his head. There néedes not <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> to come to oppoſe themſelues againſt him. They blunt the edge of this ſword, which teach this doctrine. And with this ſword alſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> armes euerie Chriſtian againſt Antichriſt: <hi>Theſe things haue I written vnto you,</hi>

                        <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Matthew,</hi> writes thus of Antichriſt, and of the onely way to bewray him: <hi>Then, that is,</hi>

                        <hi>when Antichriſts kingdome ſhall come, they which are in Iewrie, let them flie vnto the hilles. Theſe things are to be vnderſtood ſpiritually thus: Then when you ſhall ſee the abomination of deſolation, ſitting in the holy place, that is, when you ſhall ſee a wicked hereſie, which is the hoſt of Antichriſt, ſtanding in the holy places of the Church: at that time, they which are in Iewrie, let them flie to the hilles, that is, they which are Chriſtians, let them get them to the Scriptures. For as the true Iewe is a Chriſtian, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>not he which is a Iew openly, but he which is a Iew in ſecret: ſo chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome is true Iewrie, whoſe name ſignifies confeſſion or thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing: and the hilles are the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, of which hilles it is ſaid, Thou wonderfully giueſt light from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hilles.</hi>
                        </hi> And againe, of the Church he ſaith, <hi>the foundations are vpon the holy hilles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And why doth he command all chriſtians at this time to get them to the ſcriptures? <hi>Becauſe at that time ſince that hereſy hath taken place in the Church, there can be no other proofe or triall of true chriſtianitie; nor any other help for chriſtians, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would know which is the true faith, but the holy Scriptures. Before by many meanes it might be ſhewed, which was the church of Chriſt, and which was the heatheniſh Synagogue. But now, they which will know which is the true Church, can know it by no meanes elſe, but onely by the Scriptures.</hi> And after, <hi>Therefore the Lord knowing what a great confuſion of all things ſhould be in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:25632:157"/> daies; therefore he commaunds, that Chriſtians which would be ſure to know the true faith, ſhould flie to nothing elſe but to the Scriptures.</hi> Here we maie firſt learne, what Antichriſt is, not a Deuill incarnate, as the Papiſts imagine; but a wicked hereſie, which ſhall take poſſeſſion in the Church: nay in the beginning of that Homily he ſaith, <hi>That when as all hereſies are as it were the hoſt of Antichriſt: yet eſpecially that, which ſhall take vpon it the face and roume of the Church, <hi>Quae obtinuit ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae locum, &amp; stetit in loco ſancto, ita vt videatur quaſi verbum veritatis ſtetiſſe; cum non ſit verbum veritatis, ſed abominatio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolationis, id eſt, exercitus Antichriſts, qui multorum animas reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit deſolatas à Deo:</hi> which hath borne the ſhew of the Church; ſo that it ſeemed to haue continued in the holy place, as the word of truth; when as it is not the word of truth, but the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſolation, that is the hoſt of Antichriſt, which ſhall make many mens ſoules deſtitute of God.</hi> And dare anie man then venture his ſaluation vpon the bare name and ſhewe of the Church? He ſaith here plainlie, that Antichriſts hereſie ſhall haue the roume and ſhewe of the Church. Therefore it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous onely to relie vpon the Church, as manie doe nowe. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (or whoſoeuer he was that wrote this booke) a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie auncient and learned Chriſtian was of this iudgment long before Antichriſt came: and ſhall we now not beleeue it, ſeeing it with our eies? And he addeth, that the <hi>onely way nowe to trie the truth, is by the Scriptures:</hi> This is his counſell. And the Pope herein by diſſwading men from reading the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, declares plainely, that hee is Antichriſt: for as the Goſpell teacheth, <hi>He that doth euill hateth the light, and will not come neere it.</hi> Why ſhould the Pope debarre men from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſcriptures, but that he feares they would diſcouer his darkeneſſe and falſe doctrines? Neither is the comming of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> neceſſarie for the conuerſion of the Iewes. The ſcriptures doe teach vs other meanes of their conuerſion: <hi>Euen to this daie</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) <hi>when Moſes is read,</hi>

And this is the worke of God alone. And this worke doth he worke euen in a moment as many hiſtories do proue. That hereof then, no Chriſtian may dreame of any long continuance of this world, becauſe the Iewes are not as yet conuerted, when as their conuerſion is of the hand and power of God, as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> plainly teacheth, and not of the comming and preaching of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> and is as it were putting life into dead men, which God can doe in a minute.</p>

And they ſhall behold him, whom they haue pearced.</hi> That was done then, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:25632:158"/> this might be fulfilled hereafter: So that of the perſons, vpon whom this prophecie ſhall be fulfilled, it is plaine, that by <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> interpretation, they are the true naturall Iewes; and not as ſome haue here allegorically gone about to expound this place, the ſpirituall Iewes, that is, vs Chriſtians. And if S. <hi>Iohn</hi> here do plainly affirme, that this latter branch of <hi>Zacharias</hi> prophecie ſhall be fulfilled in the true Iewes; I will adde that then likewiſe the former branch of this prophecie, that is, <hi>That God will powre vpon them the ſpirit of grace and mercie,</hi> ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them. We may not diſmember the prophecies of God: If the latter part be verified in them; then ſurely it neceſſarily inferres, that the former is verified alſo.

                     <p>And that this wéeping which <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſpeakes of, ſhall be of ſuch as ſhall be ſaued, is manifeſt hereby: firſt, that the prophet ſaith, <hi>That God will powre vpon them the ſpirit of grace and mercy.</hi> This powring this aboundance of grace and mercie, argues, no doubt, the hainouſnes and the miſerablenes of their eſtate, wherein they are euen now: alſo it argues their fauourable acceptation and pardon at Gods hands. And that alſo it ſhal be of ſuch as ſhall be ſaued, appeares hereby, that the prophet declares the manner thereof ſo apparantly, euen twiſe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>They ſhall lament him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as one that lamenteth bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly for his onelie ſonne, and they ſhall be ſorie for him, as one that is ſorie for his firſt borne.</hi> No doubt this argues that this their repentance ſhall be ſyncere,<note place="margin">Gen 34.

                        <hi>They were pricked in their hearts</hi> we read; and of their baptiſme: but of the teares of anie, we read not.</p>
                     <p>Neither was it fulfilled in thoſe women, which when Chriſt was led to his paſſion, <hi>came weeping after him.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke. 23.27.</note> For theſe were but certaine women: neither do we read that they wept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but altogither, neither that anie men wept with them, but women onely. And thoſe women wept before he was pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; but this which <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſpeaks of, ſhall be after. Neither was it fulfilled in the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, as ſome other haue expounded it. Becauſe the incredulous Iewes, hauing now quite forgotten the death of Chriſt, when as Ieruſalem was deſtroyed, neuer thought of Chriſt: neither that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all thoſe euils for his ſake, but rather for the ſins of ſome ſeditious perſons, and of ſome other that then were in the citie, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> himſelfe thought: <hi>I will not refuſe to ſpeake that</hi> (ſaith hée) <hi>which ſorrow enforceth me to ſpeake: I ſuppoſe,</hi>

Let vs marke diligently here alſo, how the Euangeliſt cals it the ſigne of the ſonne of man, and not the ſigne of the ſonne of God. And therefore ſhall be an humble and not a glorious ſigne.

He humbled himſelfe and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the croſſe. Wherefore God hath alſo greatly exalted him, and giuen him a name aboue euerie name.</hi> On the croſſe appeared his greateſt humilitie. So that the croſſe in this reſpect, may verie fitly be called the ſigne of the ſonne of man. And this alſo the ſpéeches of the Iewes ſpoken to our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, may inſinnate. <hi>If he be the king of the Iewes let him come down from the croſſe: And we will beleeue in him.</hi> It was the croſſe that they ſtumbled at:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.42.

                        <hi>Ieremy</hi> alſo agrees with <hi>Daniel,</hi> both concerning the day and the Iewes deliuerance: <hi>Alas for this day is great, none hath bin like it; it is euen the time of <hi>Iacobs</hi> trouble: yet ſhall he be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it.

And ſo the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> alſo deſcribes that daie: <hi>A day of blackneſſe and of darkneſſe,</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince Chriſt is on our ſide, let vs not feare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al: but putting our confidence in Almightie God, let vs cleaue faſt to the Kings Maieſtie our ſupreme head in earth, next vnder Chriſt, of this Church of England; as faithfull ſubiects, by Gods law ought to do. Though they go about to ſtirre Gog and Magog, and all the rauenours of the world againſt vs, yet we truſt in God verily, and doubt not but they ſhal haue ſuch a ruine and ouerthrow, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in his 39. chapter, againſt Gog &amp; Magog go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to deſtroy the people of God: whom the people of God ſhall ſo vanquiſh and ouerthrow on the mountains of Iſrael, that none of them ſhall eſcape, but their carcaſſes there to lie, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by kites, and crowes, and birds of the aire. And if they ſhal perſiſt in this their peſtilent malice, to make inuaſion into this Realme; then let vs wiſh that their great captaine Gog (I meane the Biſhop of Rome) may come with them, to drinke with them of the ſame cup, that he maliciouſly goeth about to prepare for vs, that the people of God might after ſurely liue in peace.</hi> Thus far Biſhop Tunſtall. By whom we may learne theſe notable leſſons: that the Pope hath béene no peacemaker, but a maker of wars, theſe many yéeres; and therefore he is the child of the diuell, by his iudgement. Secondly, that all true ſubiects ought to truſt in God and their Prince: and not to feare anie inuaſions, he ſhall deuiſe againſt them. Thirdly, that he is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:25632:167"/> that <hi>Gog,</hi> that hidden and hypocriticall enemie of Chriſt, of whom <hi>Ezechiel</hi> prophecieth, and that he and all his ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and all their attempts againſt Gods Church ſhall not proſper. <hi>Tunſtal</hi> a man of great learning and iudgement ſaw thus much in his daies, when the daie of the goſpel began but to ſhine: and ſhal not we now in the cléere ſunſhine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, acknowledge ſo much.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> againe: he anſweres to the former place,<note place="margin">De Rom. pont. lib. 3. ca. 6.</note> that I haue alleadged out of <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon <hi>Malachie: That although <hi>Ierome</hi> in this place was of this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet in his Commentaries vpon <hi>Matthew</hi> he taught the contrarie.</hi> But Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth miſtake <hi>Ierome:</hi> For <hi>Ierome</hi> himſelfe doth not ſay vpon <hi>Matthew,</hi> that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall com before the ſecond comming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">In Mat. ca. 11.</note> but he there ſhewes the opinions of others. Theſe be his words. <hi>There are ſome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which thinke that therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> was called <hi>Elias,</hi> that as in the ſecond comming of Chriſt, according to <hi>Malachie, Elias</hi> muſt come before, &amp; muſt ſhew the comming of the Iudge: So <hi>Iohn</hi> did in his firſt comming. And ſo they both are meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers either of his firſt comming, or of his ſecond. Ierome</hi> ſhewes here the opinion of others, and not his owne, why <hi>Iohn</hi> was called <hi>Elias,</hi> which he had ſet downe before in theſe words. <hi>That <hi>Iohn</hi> was called <hi>Elias,</hi> not according to the opinion of ſome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Philoſophers, and certaine heretiques, which bring in tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of ſoules from one bodie to another; but becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to another teſtimonie of the goſpell, he came in the power and ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and that he had the ſame grace or meaſure of the holy ſpirit, which <hi>Elias</hi> had. And alſo, the auſteritie of life, and courage of mind, both of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> were equall. Hee was in the wilderneſſe; ſo alſo was he: He was girded with a gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a skinne; ſo alſo was he: He becauſe he rebuked <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezabell</hi> of their wickednes, was compelled to flie; he becauſe he reproued the vnlawfull mariage of <hi>Herode</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi> loſt his head.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Ieromes</hi> conſiderations, why he thought <hi>Iohn</hi> might be compared to <hi>Elias.</hi> Then he addes. <hi>(There be ſome others that thinke, &amp;c.)</hi> As though that which followes, were not his opinion, but the opinion of ſom others, whom he alſo makes mention of in that other place of <hi>Malachie,</hi> which I haue before alleadged. And there he cals them plainely Iewiſh heretikes.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:25632:167"/> And the ſame opinion of others concerning the comming of <hi>Elias, Ierom</hi> alleadgeth in other places, and he inueieth againſt all ſuch followers of Iewiſh fables. <hi>Iohannes Viualdus</hi> a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt <hi>(in opere regali de duodecima perſecutione eccleſiae Dei)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes plainly, <hi>that <hi>Ierom</hi> thought,</hi>

                        </hi> So that <hi>Ierom</hi> in this matter is not contrarie to himſelfe, as Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue him: but all one: Nay he is ſo farre from being of the Papiſts opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning Antichriſt, that although the booke were ſealed and this matter concealed from the fathers, and by degrées, &amp; not all at once opened to the church (as we maie note in the Reuelation:) yet euen by that ſmall light of Gods word,<note place="margin">Reu. 5.2. &amp; 6.1.</note> which at that time was giuen the Church of this matter, he aiming at the truth, doth quite ouerthrow the Papiſts opinion.</p>
                     <p>For vpon the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Malachie,</hi> he writes thus: <hi>The Iewes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vnderſtand that which is ſpoken here of the prophet <hi>(Behold I will ſend my Angell)</hi>
                        </hi> of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet: and that which followes <hi>(The Lord whom you ſeeke for, ſhall by and by come to his temple, and the Angell of the testament whom you would haue) <hi>they referre to their Meſſias; that is, to their Chriſt, who they ſay ſhall come in the ende of the world. But I maruell how that the verie experience of the things which haue chanced, hath not taught them the truth: for what temple ſhall their Lord find, which is ouerthrowne to the verie foundation? Or is it to be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp againe, of any other before Chriſts comming? What ſhal their Chriſt do more? when as all things are reſtored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate of another. Our Lord in the Goſpell, expounding</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>to be</hi> Iohn Baptiſt, <hi>ſaith: If you will vnderſtand, he is</hi> Elias <hi>which is to come, of whom alſo this ſame Prophet, whom we now expound, ſpeakes of in the end of his propheſie:</hi> Behold I wil ſend you <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet before that great and fearefull day of the Lord come. <hi>But how</hi> Iohn <hi>alſo might be called</hi> Elias, <hi>he gaue vs alſo to vnderſtand, ſaying,</hi> that he came in the power and spirit of <hi>Elias.</hi>
                        </hi> Thus farre <hi>Ierome.</hi> Where he plainly out of the ſcriptures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Papiſts opinion concerning Antichriſt: <hi>Whom they teach ſhall be borne in Babylon, of the tribe of Dan: and when he ſhall come to Ieruſalem, circumciſing himſelfe, he ſhall ſay to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:25632:168"/> the Iewes, I am Chriſt promiſed vnto you. Then all the Iewes ſhall flocke vnto him: and they ſhall build againe the temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the Romans. And he ſhall ſit there, ſaying that hee is God: and ſhall kill <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi>
                        </hi> This is the Papiſts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Antichriſt; as it is ſet downe in their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon, by <hi>Ioh. de Ianua</hi> a Frier. And this their opinion <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> in this place manifeſtly refutes, who ſaith, that the temple ſhall not be built againe, and that <hi>Elias</hi> in his owne perſon ſhal not come, but that in <hi>Iohn</hi> the propheſie of <hi>Malachie</hi> was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that all things are reſtored alreadie, which is the ende for which our Sauiour ſaith, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come. And <hi>Iohn Baptiſt ſhall turne the hearts of the fathers vnto the children, and the vnbeleeuers to the wiſedome of the iuſt, to make a perfect people to the Lord,</hi> as the Angell teacheth, which is the end alſo why <hi>Malachie</hi> ſaieth, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:25632:168"/> this matter: Let vs heare the opinion of <hi>Rupertus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rupertus in Malac.</note> a great learned Papiſt, who touching this matter writes thus: <hi>Of the comming of <hi>Elias,</hi> I dare determine nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of the Doctors, to whom we almoſt all agree, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he ſhal come in deed, and that he ſhall reſtore all things, and that he ſhall be put to death.

                        </hi> And therefore by and by after be addeth: <hi>If ye will receiue him, <hi>Iohn</hi> is that ſame <hi>Elias,</hi> which is to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we maie plainly ſée that by <hi>Rupertus</hi> his iudgement, <hi>Ierom</hi> neuer changed his opinion; as Maſt. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would make vs beléeue, that he did. Againe, we maie note here <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> bulwarke againſt all the ſayings of the fathers in this matter, which muſt be ours alſo, not onely in this; but in all other doubts and controuerſies whatſoeuer. He alleadgeth the authority of the Goſpel againſt all the ſayings of the Fathers: and ſo muſt we doe, not onely in this, but in all other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies whatſoeuer: If all the fathers ſéeme to teach that which is contrarie to the ſcriptures, we muſt here with <hi>Ierom</hi> forſake them all, and cleaue to the authoritie of the ſcriptures. No doubt <hi>Ierom</hi> had read <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtine,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Auſten,</hi> which all ſeeme to ſaie, that <hi>Elias</hi> himſelfe ſhall come: but he preferres, as we maie here plainely ſée, the authoritie of the Goſpell before all theſe.</p>
                     <p>That reſolution alſo of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> concerning this matter,<note place="margin">Theo. in Gen. queſt. 45.</note> is worth the marking, who vpon <hi>Geneſis</hi> writes thus: Hee makes this queſtion: <hi>Into what place did the God of all things tranſlate <hi>Enoch?</hi> He anſwereth, that we are not to enquire for thoſe things, which are committed to ſilence: but we are to reuerence thoſe things which are written. I thinke that the God of all things hath done this, to comfort his valiant champions. For when as <hi>Abel</hi> the firſt fruit of righteouſneſſe, being as yet vnripe, was cut vp by the rootes; and then no hope of the reſurrection did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:25632:169"/> men.

For for this cauſe, he beheld him when he was ſlaine, and he alſo tranſlated <hi>Enoch,</hi> that by him he might declare to all men the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, that ſhould be. For he which in this life hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the reward of his vertue, ſhall moſt aſſuredly obtaine it in the life to come.</hi> I would to God all Chriſtians would here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſell of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and not be curious in ſearching for the comming of <hi>Elias,</hi> or other ſuch hard points, which the ſcripture hath not reueiled vnto vs: but reuerently meditate vpon thoſe things which are plaine and are written. <hi>Ierom</hi> alſo takes away that ſame offence, whereat manie at this day ſtumble, which is the outward name and ſhew of the Church.

                        <hi>Then ſaw I another Angell</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn) <hi>flie in the midſt of heauen, hauing an euerlaſting goſpell to preach to them that dwell on earth, and to euerie nation and kinred, and tongue, and people; ſaying with a loud voice; Feare God, &amp; giue glorie to him: For the houre of his iudgement is come: worſhip him that made heauen and earth, and the ſea, and the fountaines of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

                     <p>And as the wine of this whore is manifeſt; ſo is her ſeat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as I noted before: ſo that as he is deafe, that will not heare the crying of the Angell concerning her poiſoned wine; ſo he is blind wilfully that will not ſee her ſeuen hils, whereon ſhe is ſituated.</p>

                        <hi>We haue had the heauens ouer our heads like Iron: we haue not had raine enough in winter to nouriſh the corne, nor in ſommer the accuſtomed heat to ripen it. The earth as the ſcripture hath foretold, is become like braſſe vnto vs. Our labour is employed in vain, the earth bringeth not forth her buddes &amp; bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, the trees beare not their Apples. The earth is as it were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with drought, and her mould brings forth withered hearbs: the haile hinders the vines: we ſow our lands in vaine, which the enemies deuoure. How many ouerflowings of the ſea haue we ſeene? how often her fortreſſes being broken, haue we beheld the ſhepheard to ſwim with his ſheepe, the mother with her children; and the houſe and the heard, to ſwim togither with their maſters;

That now her mightie prouinces being giuen for a praie to the Germanes, Frenchmen, Engliſhmen, Scots, Iriſh men, and to other forraine enemies, obey now their vnſatiable and wicked pleaſures. Neither is heere an end of our euils: But that all euils might come vpon vs at once, moſt grieuous plagues, new and ſtraunge diſeaſes haue taken away thoſe, whom the ſword and famine had ſpared, and haue made ſuch great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes of men, that skant the liuing ſufficed to burie the dead.

And if here were an end of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, all were well: but it goes further. For thoſe euils which we haue hitherto recited, are outward euils; and do neither adde anie thing, or take ought away from mans felicitie, if his ſoule within him were ſound and free from theſe daungers and miſeries. But the euils which are within vs, are farre greater then they, which are without vs. Our vnderſtanding is blind; our will is prone to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes; our memorie pliable to al earthly things.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:25632:172"/> that, by thoſe ten plagues of Egypt, theſe ten perſecutions of the Roman Emperours were prophetically ſignified. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of thoſe which thinke thus, theſe are wittily and exquiſitly compared the one to the other, but not by the ſpirit of prophecie, but by mans coniecture, which ſometimes proues true, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falſe.</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtens</hi> chiefe reaſon againſt this opinion is, becauſe of the number: For that there haue beene, and may be more perſecutions, then ten or eleuen againſt the Church of God. But to let the number go, the matter of this expoſition may ſéeme fitly to agrée with the other prophecies of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>If Antichriſts kingdome be ſpiritually Egypt,</hi> as ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth it; then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a type of Antichriſt, and fitly may we coniecture that he ſhal both deale in Gods Church, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and alſo periſh, as he did.

                        </hi> (that through the filth of ſin he periſh not) <hi>but by keeping thy word?</hi> But the Pope hath taken this word from children, from young men, from all men: Therefore he hath taken away their ſtrength, and in them he hath defiled and polluted their waies. And therefore he hath as much as in him lies killed them: For God hath teſtified, that <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die.</hi> And as alſo that other <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened mens backs and bodies; ſo hath he burthened all mens conſciences with the obſeruations of his ſuperſtitious lawes. And is he not then rightly <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> This perſecution of Gods Church comming out of Egypt, makes alſo the ſame moſt manifeſt: Since the firſt day that Gods people began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his blinde ſuperſtition, he hath neuer ceaſed to perſecute them. And as in his doings he is a <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo he ſhall be <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> in his ende.</p>
                     <p>And here the papiſts opinion concerning Antichriſt how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd is it, and againſt all reaſon; that another Antichriſt ſhould be borne in Babylon, and ſhould come with ſuch a power, that he ſhould perſecute the Church of Chriſt more then euer it hath béene perſecuted. I thinke, they thinke that Antichriſt when he comes, ſhall not be able to ouercome their Pope; and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:25632:173"/> yet this he muſt doe, if their opinion be true. The Turke hath not beene able to ouercome Chriſtendome, for all his might, riches and power: and do they thinke that euer any ſhall ariſe mightier then he?<note place="margin">Ianſ. har. Eu. ca. 22.</note>

                     <p>But to make the matter more plaine,<note place="margin">Aug. de cura pro mortuis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend. cap. 13.</note> Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke writes thus of his mother, to the ſame effect which he wrote before: <hi>Let euerie one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take this that I write, as he liſt</hi> (Belike he thought he ſhould offend ſome with this his doctrine: there were ſome then that began to truſt in them which were dead.) <hi>If the ſoules which are dead, knew what we did which are aliue, ſurely then they would ſpeake vnto vs, when as we ſee them in our ſleepes. And that I may let others paſſe, ſurely my louing mother would neuer a night forſake me, which followed me both by ſea and by land, that ſhe might liue with me. God forbid, that now hauing obtained a more happy life, ſhe ſhould become cruell, and ſhould not now comfort her ſonne, whom ſhe loued ſo dearely, whom ſhe could neuer abide to ſee ſorrowfull. But ſurely that which the holy Pſalme ſounds in our eares is true; becauſe my <hi>father and my mother haue forſaken me; but the Lord hath taken me vp.</hi> If therefore our parents haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken vs, how know they our cares and affaires? And if our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents know not this, what other dead men know what we doe, or what we ſuffer? <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet ſaith: <hi>Thou art our father, for</hi> Abraham <hi>is ignorant of vs, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>knowes vs not.</hi> If ſuch great Patriarkes knew not what became of the people which ſprang of them, to whom (beleeuing in God) God promiſed that a people ſhould ſpring of their ſtocke; how ſhall other dead men be preſent and intermingle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to help &amp; know the actions and affaires of theirs? How ſhall we ſay that God dealt wel with them, which died before the euils came, which followed after their death, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death they alſo feele what things happen in the miſerable
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:25632:182"/> life of man? Doe we peraduenture erre in ſaying theſe things of them? And doe we account them to be at reſt; whom the diſquiet life of the liuing grieues? &amp;c.</hi> This doctrine <hi>Auſten</hi> doeth not onely affirme; but alſo prooues by the example of his mother; and alſo by manie other teſtimonies of the Scriptures: and ſhall we not beléeue him? Surelie if the Saintes departed know not our affaires here in this worlde after their deaths, much leſſe doe they know and heare our prayers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of our workes, <hi>Let vs not loſe our works:</hi> ſo ſaie I of our moſt excellent worke, that is prayer, let vs not loſe our prayers.</p>
                     <p>But here ſome maie obiect that <hi>Auſten</hi> doth ſaie in the ſame booke,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>that he that buries his friend nie the graue of a Martyr, reaps this commoditie thereby to his friend, that he commends the ſame ſoule to the Martyr, by his deuout prayer and affection:</hi> and that therefore <hi>Auſten</hi> allowes prayers made to Martyrs. But how doubtfull in this his aſſertion he is, let all men iudge. This is his opinion,<note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> which I haue noted before: <hi>That Martyrs ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by their owne proper natures cannot be preſent to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the liuing, nor know what they doe; but by Gods power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they may; as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared to Chriſt.</hi> But how ſhall we know this; that as often as we praie vnto them, God giues that grace extraordinarilie vnto them, that they maie heare vs: no man liuing can aſcertaine vs hereof. And of the miracles that are done at their verie toombes, where if they be in any place preſent, they ſhould be moſt preſent, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten</hi> writes thus: <hi>Although this queſtion paſſeth my capacitie to know how Martyrs helpe them, whom it is certaine are holpen by them; whether they themſelues are preſent at one time in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie places, and ſo farre one from another? or whether they may be preſent at all, where their memories are; or whether they may be preſent euery where, where their memories are not; or whether they being in places correſpondent to their merits, and being quite remooued from the knowledge of all affaires; and yet praying ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for the neceſſities of ſuch, as doe pray vnto them: As we alſo pray for the dead, whom we ſee not, neither know where they are, or what they doe: God almighty who is preſent euerie where, neither being mixt with vs nor yet ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, hearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Martyrs by the miniſterie of Angels, which are ſpred abroad
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:25632:182"/> here and there, yeeld vnto men theſe comforts, which he knowes they ſtand need of in this life, and ſo doth commend vnto vs by his wonderfull and vnſpeakeable power and goodneſſe, the merits of his Martyrs where he pleaſeth, when he pleaſeth, and how he pleaſeth; but eſpecially at their memories, becauſe he knowes this to be moſt profitable for vs to edifie the faith of Chriſt, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of which, they haue ſuffered. This matter is a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I can reach vnto, and more deepe then I can ſearch. Therefore whether of theſe two be true, or perchance whether they both, that at ſometimes theſe things may be done by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Martyrs, or at ſome other times by the Angels, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon them the perſons of the Martyrs: I dare not determine, I had rather learne theſe things of thoſe that know them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auſten</hi> here plainlie affirmes, that Martyrs by their owne natures ordinarilie know not what we doe here, but by Gods power they maie. Againe, that we praying for the dead, doe neither know what they doe; nor where they are: ſo the ſaints maie praie for vs generallie not knowing our eſtates.</p>
                     <p>And here, although he ſéeme to allow praier for the dead (as he doth alſo in other places of that booke) yet he declares here in what ſenſe they then prayed for them; not knowing what they did, nor where they were: and therefore this their praying for the dead, makes nothing for the popiſh purgatorie. They knew not where they were, for whom they praied: therefore they praied not to helpe them out of purgatorie, as the papiſts teach. Therefore their prayers for the dead,<note place="margin">Cap. 1. ciuſd. lib.</note> which S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith was vſed of the whole Church in thoſe daies, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the praying for the dead, which now the Papiſts vſe. They had another meaning in thoſe their prayers, then they haue now. They praied as it were of a certaine Chriſtian duetie; declaring thereby their affections and loue to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; but they praie now to helpe them out of purgatorie. And in this ſenſe alſo S. <hi>Auſten</hi> praied for his mother,<note place="margin">Li. 9. conf. c. 13.</note> which the Papiſts alleadge to confirme their prayers for the dead, which is nothing to the purpoſe. <hi>I beleeue</hi> (ſaith he, praying to God for his mother) <hi>that thou haſt done already that which I pray for; yet O Lord accept the free will offerings of my mouth. Auſten</hi> beléeued verilie, that God had alreadie done that which he praied for; yet to declare (as ſhould ſéeme) his deuotion, he
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:25632:183"/> alſo wiſhed the ſame. Such were the prayers which the Church and the Fathers, in thoſe daies made for the dead.</p>
                     <p>And as concerning theſe prayers for the dead, this is his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate iudgement, that not for all in general, but for thoſe alone, who when they were aliue here deſerued that thoſe prayers might helpe, ſuch praiers are auaileable. But how contrarie is this to the ſaying of the wiſe man?<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.3.</note> That <hi>the tree lies where it fals:</hi> after it be once downe there is no remoouing it. And how contrarie is this to that which S. <hi>Auſten</hi> els where writes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:<note place="margin">Epiſt. 86.</note> 
                        <hi>That euerie one ought to be carefull of the laſt day of his life? For in what ſtate ſoeuer, the laſt day of his life ſhall find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man, in the ſame ſhall the laſt day of the world alſo take him: becauſe what kinde of one he now dies, ſuch a one at that day ſhal he be iudged.</hi> If this be true, there is no hope of profiting any man after he be dead. And herein he ſéemes to agrée with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6.2. &amp; 5.</note> who ſaith, that <hi>now we ought to beare one anothers burthen,</hi> as long as we liue here. But after this life, <hi>euerie one muſt bear his owne burthen:</hi> then there is no bearing one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, no eaſing, helping, or relieuing one another. So that this opinion of S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> of working here in this life, that hee maie be holpen hereafter, is both againſt the doctrine of the ſcriptures, &amp; alſo contrarie to that, which himſelfe hath taught in other places.</p>
                     <p>But to returne againe to the Martyrs: S. <hi>Auſten</hi> in that booke writes;<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>That Martyrs or dead men appeare to vs after their deaths, as we appeare to others that dreame of vs, we not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we doe appeare. Nay he thinkes that thoſe apparitions are of Angels, which appeare ſometimes to men, and commaund that their bodies ſhould be buried, when as they themſelues whoſe bodies they are, know no ſuch thing.</hi> If <hi>Auſten</hi> ſmelled thus much in his daies, concerning burying of bodies of Saints, that they were not the ſaints themſelues that appeared, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (the ſaints neuer knowing) we may ſuſpect that they were alſo euill angels, that did appeare then, becauſe they lied: but if they were good angels, as <hi>Auſten</hi> thought, yet we maie iudge of the like thus much, that thoſe apparitions which were in time of Poperie, which often appeared and craued to be holpen out of purgatorie, in the likeneſſe of mens ſoules; were not their ſoules, nor perchance the ſoules of ſuch neuer knew anie ſuch

Neither knew they all things; but ſuch things, as Gods prouidence iudged fit for them to know.</hi> So that by S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> iudgement firſt it is vncertaine, whether the Saints know anie thing at all of our earthlie affaires or no. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if they know, they know not all things; but ſuch things as God reueales to them, and thinks méete for them to know. And now in this vncertaintie of their knowledges, who will make their prayers vnto them, and not be ſure whether they be heard or not? eſpeciallie when as the ſame S. <hi>Auſten</hi> in another place writes, <hi>If faith want, prayer dies:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De verb. dom. ſecund. Lucam ſer. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>for who will pray, that beleeues not? Wherfore the bleſſed Apoſtle, when as he exhorted to prayer, ſaid: <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued.</hi>
                        </hi> And that hee might ſhew faith to be the fountaine of praier, neither that the ſtreame can runne, where as the head of the water is dried vp; he added and ſaid: <hi>But howe ſhall they call vpon him, in whom they haue not beleeued? <hi>Therefore that we may pray aright: let vs beleeue, and let vs pray alſo that faith faile not, by which we pray.</hi>
                        </hi> So that without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faith that our praiers are heard and obtained, praiers by S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> iudgment in this place are nought: but ſuch praiers can no man make to ſaints.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Ser. 120. de temp.</note> he teacheth that <hi>prayers are now the ſacrifices of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Therefore God commanded the Iewes to leaue the whole land, and to offer ſacrifices in one place, and to pay their vowes, becauſe then all the land was vncleane with the ſmoake of Altars, and with the ſauour of graues, and with other pollutions, which from the ſacriledge of the prophane Gentiles were brought vpon it. But to vs nowe that Chriſt is comed, and hath purged the whole earth, all places are become places fit for vs to pray in.

At which ſacrifice as men of God which through the confeſſion of his faith haue ouercome the world, they are named in their place and order: yet they are not called vpon of the prieſt, when he ſacrificeth: for he offers ſacrifice to God, and not to them; although he offer ſacrifice at their memorials: for hee is Gods prieſt, and not theirs. And the ſacrifice he offers, is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, which he offers not to them, becauſe they are it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</hi> Here S. <hi>Auſten</hi> doth teach vs moſt manifeſtlie, theſe thrée things: That ſacrifice belongs onlie to God, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation is ſacrifice; and that the bodie of Chriſt which the Prieſt offers, is not Chriſts naturall bodie (as the Papiſts teach and would haue vs beléeue, that S. <hi>Auſten</hi> taught, when he ſpeakes of the oblation of Chriſts bodie in the Euchariſt) but his myſticall bodie: and the ſacrifice of that bodie, I think the Papiſts will not ſaie, anie thing profits the dead. And if inuocation be ſacrifice, as S. <hi>Auſten</hi> here plainlie teacheth; ſhall we inuocate martyrs and ſaints? If the prieſts in thoſe daies did not inuocate them: ſhall we now?

This ſeemes to be a kinde of reuerence: but it is a prepoſterous reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence proceeding of fleſh and bloud. As many for their vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe thinke that they diſhonour God, if they pray vnto him, or receiue the ſacraments: But faith thinkes farre otherwiſe; that is, that he diſhonors God, which ſins; and not he which craueth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and vſeth the meanes ordained of God to heale his ſinnes: ſo he diſhonoureth God, not which endures his ſeruice, but he that refuſeth him, and preferres his owne iudgement before the will of God. It is a good thing to confeſſe our owne vnworthineſſe: nay we ought to doe it. It is a good thing alſo to reuerence the Maieſtie of God: but this goodneſſe turnes it ſelfe into ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we exclude the ſeruice of Chriſt for out vnworthines. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs not feare to come vnto God, becauſe he commaunds vs to come vnto him, and to call vpon him: <hi>Come to me</hi>

                        </hi> And againe, <hi>thou diſhonoureſt him with the greateſt diſhonour that may be, if he calling thee vnto him, and promiſing thee helpe; thou deſpiſe him, by not comming vnto him: ſo alſo thou yeeldeſt greateſt honour vnto Chriſt, when as thou endureſt his ſeruice towards thee. Hence it is, that <hi>Marie</hi> ſitting as it were quietly and idly at Ieſus feete, &amp; enduring Chriſts miniſterie which he yeelded vnto her by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, is farre more honourably commended, then buſie <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha.</hi>

So alſo in our neceſſities concerning theſe our temporall and worldly things, we reſpect neither our owne vnworthineſſe, not the dignitie of any other; ſo that we may be helped and relieued.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:25632:185"/> that is, their words: therfore we muſt begin to climbe vp to God, by the hearing of his worde. He that receiueth this, receiueth Chriſt: and he that hath Chriſt, hath the Father: and he that hath the Father, hath all good things, &amp;c.</hi> So that to heare Gods word is the firſt ſteppe to climbe to God: and then in what caſe are they, that refuſe to hear Gods word preached.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:25632:188"/> how great the power of the Church, that is, of the congregation of the faithfull is, to which aboue he would haue the vnrepentant brother to be manifeſted, that is to ſay, that if two of them onely agreeing togither, they ſhall obtaine whatſoeuer they will, much more the iudgement of any whole congregation is to be feared. And no doubt, that thing which ſhe will, ſhall be allowed of God. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Ianſenius. <hi>The force of Excommunication lies in the conſent and communion of the praiers of the Church. Take this common conſent awaie, and take awaie alſo excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.

For Chriſt is ſaid to be in the midſt of any that doe agree, not onely by reaſon of the preſence of his diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, according to which he is euery where; but by reaſon of his ſpeciall grace and aſſiſtance, by which he makes their prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God his father: as though alſo they were powred out of him, or as though he did accept them &amp; perfect them.

Againe, Chriſt here teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs how we ought to deale with him that is excommunicate. For he is not to be accounted as an enemy; but through the ſame charitie wherwith nothing is omitted for his amendment, we muſt alſo pray for him, that God would conuert him, whom man by all his diligence and by doing what he could, could not conuert. And Chriſt here promiſeth that he will grant whatſoeuer we ſhall deſire for our brother, if we ſhall continue in charitie. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Ferus. <hi>Here we maie note, that the ſentence of excommunication muſt be done by common conſent &amp; knowledge of the Church, and likewiſe their common prayers to God for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                        <hi>Vpon this promiſe and ground, no doubt the common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the faithfull in the primitiue Church were grounded: As appeareth in the actes of the Apoſtles, where ſaint</hi> Luke <hi>thus deſcribeth the eſtate of the primitiue Church, immediatelie after Chriſt:</hi>

                        </hi> Ferus <hi>vpon this place writes thus:</hi> Though they had <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> a certaine promiſe of the holy ghoſt, yet without ceaſing they continued in prayer: For there is no Church where there is no praier. Againe, they praied with one accord. There is no Church where there is not vnanimitie. The prayers are not acceptable, where there is no concord. Laſtly, they continued in prayer: for he is not worthie to be heard, which doth not continue in prayer. And this was the chiefe worke which <hi>Luke</hi> left in writing of the Apoſtles. Such was the firſt Church, but now the matter is altered; now there is another ſtate of the Church. <hi>The brawles and quarrels which are in the Church</hi> Ferus <hi>miſlikes.

                        <hi>The like forme of common praiers we read in the Acts, when the Apoſtles were forbidden to preach in the name of Ieſus:</hi>

                        <hi>Aſſoone as they were let go, they came to their fellowes, &amp; ſhewed all that the high Prieſts &amp; Elders had ſaid vnto them: And when they heard it, they lift vp their voices to God with one accord &amp; ſaid &amp;c. <hi>Here is the forme of common prayers the Apoſtles vſed, they lift vp their voices to God altogither: no doubt they vnderſtood their praiers.

Theſe benefits they ſhould know aſſuredlie, they did reape by their prayers: and that they were to obtaine them by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes but by prayer. And therefore ſéeing they are ſuch
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:25632:190"/> things, as no man can be without, &amp; all men greatlieſt deſire, it behooueth them eſpecially to praie for theſe: and as they know and vnderſtand the price of them, to be ſo much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt by their prayers in begging them of God.

For he which attentiuely &amp; with a ſtrong faith conſiders how great the maieſtie of God is, and how great is our vileneſſe, &amp; how great the matter is which we require at Gods hands, it is not almoſt poſſible, but that he ſhould come to pray humbly, reuerently and feruently. <hi>Thus farre M.</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

                        <hi>Where he makes the conſideration and knowledge of the thing we begge at Gods hands, a meanes to make Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deuout in their praiers. But they which praie in Latine, lacke this conſideration: therefore their praiers cannot bee made but without deuotion. So that here M.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>ſéems to require knowledge in praier, that their praiers maie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and pleaſe God. But in other places he goes about to prooue, that praiers not vnderſtood maie pleaſe God. And he alleadgeth arguments to confirme the ſame:</hi> The prieſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> in the olde law prayed for the people in the Tabernacle, and the people tarried without, and neither vnderſtood nor knewe what he prayed. <hi>Firſt here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſt was a ſhadow of Chriſt, who alone entred into the tabernacle, and the people might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in with him: and therefore could not vnderſtand his praiers: but his praiers were ſuch as if they had bin preſent, they might haue vnderſtood. And therefore this makes nothing for their Latine ſeruice, where prieſt and people are both preſent togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Secondly, he alleadgeth, that</hi> the Church praies for infidels and wicked men, which would not that ſhe ſhould pray for them: and yet no doubt her prayers doe them good. <hi>But here the Church doth vnderſtand her prayers. The queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that reapeth good by a prayer, ſhould vnderſtand it or not. But whether he that makes anie praier, either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or for anie other, ought to praie with vnderſtanding, and to know the praier he makes? Surely he that praies for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or for himſelfe, and knowes not what he praies, ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do himſelfe nor the other anie good. As they which in times paſt ſaid <hi>de profundis</hi> for them which were dead, did no doubt not profit them: naie if they had vnderſtood what they had ſaide, they would neuer haue ſaid it for the dead, which was made of one liuing for himſefe: neither are the dead ſo much as once named therein.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, he alleadgeth ſome ſayings of the fathers, as of</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen <hi>and</hi> Chryſoſtome: That as charmers by words not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood doe driue Serpents out of their holes: ſo the word of God being read, and yet not thorowly vnderſtood, is of much more force againſt the Diuell. <hi>But theſe fathers ſpeake not of the Scriptures, read in a ſtrange language of the people, that they ſhould be of anie force; but onely of ſome darke and obſcure
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:25632:192"/> places, which being read and paſſed ouer, although not thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnderſtood, with ſome other plainer places, might yet profit the ſoule, and daunt the enemy: as did the Eunuches reading of the Prophet</hi> Eſay, <hi>who no doubt vnderſtood the words hee read (as they doe not of their Latine praiers) although he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the meaning of the wordes. For he coulde ſaie,</hi> Of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet, of himſelfe or of another? <hi>But theſe places make nothing for praier, which ſpeake of reading the Scripture. Laſtly, he alleadgeth</hi> Auſten, That one praying the prayers which heretikes haue made, not knowing them to be heretikes prayers, may reape good by them. <hi>But this is nothing to the purpoſe: So the praier be good, and praied with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and a liuely faith, it makes no matter who made it.</hi>

And were not ſuch like, all the Latine praiers, which without vnderſtanding, the ſimple people made in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie? He confeſſeth that amongſt all other our ſpirituall workes, Satan labours eſpeciallie to hinder our praiers, or to peruert them, which thing he néede not doe in Poperie: he had framed them (as the common prouerb is) the bowe to his own bent.

And theſe are, praying, reading, and wel-doing. In theſe ſhould a wiſe man daily exerciſe himſelfe; and ſo diſcreetly with Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> zeale, meaſure and diuide his time, that he ſhould be euer occupied in one of theſe.

                        <hi>And he addeth,</hi> that the third effect of prayer is the ſpirituall refreſhing of the ſoule.

If this be true, then the papiſts haue bereaued their brethren of this chiefe fruit of prayer, which is the ſpirituall refreſhing of their ſoules, when as they taught them to pray in Latine; when as they neither vnderſtood the words of their prayer, nor the thing they prayed for.

And again of praier, he writes thus:</hi> In the power of this Lord <hi>(meaning Ieſus Chriſt)</hi> let vs come to the throne of grace, with great confidence, being aſſured that whatſoeuer we ſhall aske in his name, we ſhall obtaine it. This is the chiefe condition: which our petition or prayer ought to haue ioyned with it, that it may be of force with God (<hi>as ſaint</hi> Iames <hi>ſaith</hi>) that is to ſay, <hi>faith and ſure confidence,</hi> which ought chiefely to be grounded, not in our ſelues or in our owne works or merits, but in the merits of Chriſt Ieſus, and alſo in the infinite goodnes and mercie of God, which can be ouercome by no kinde of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and chiefely on the truth of the word and promiſes of God, who through the whole ſcripture promiſeth, that he will neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, which turne to him with their whole heart, call vpon him, and haue all their hope moſt aſſuredly repoſed in him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou haſt beene hitherto a moſt grieuous ſinner; yet thou muſt not therefore be diſcouraged: for as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, ſins that are paſt do not condemne vs, if now they do not pleaſe vs. By which words we may plainly perceiue, how greatly they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, who waighing their owne wants and infirmities, doe deſpaire of the mercie of God: as though God would not heare them, if ſo be they pray vnto him. And they do not conſider, that the principal foundation of this confidence, are the merits of Chriſt, the mercie of God, and the truth of his words, which is as it were a ſhield, as the kingly Prophet ſaith: <hi>Compaſsing about all them that truſt in him: <hi>No ſinner, by his iudgement, ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, though his ſinnes be neuer ſo grieuous; but ought bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to come to the throne of grace: and what néedes then the interceſſion of ſaints?

                        </hi> Dauid <hi>ſaith: <hi>Thou O Lord alone makes me dwell in ſafetie,</hi> and ſecurelie: what foundation can man haue of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or ſecuritie, beſide this? Againe, of the excellencie of the name of Ieſus in another place, he writes thus:</hi> Thy name
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:25632:195"/> is like oyle powred out: without all doubt there is a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betwixt oyle and the name of the bridegroome; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy ghoſt not in vaine, hath compared the one of them to the other. And I ſay for three properties of oyle, becauſe it giues light, it feeds, and it makes ſoft; if you can yeeld no better reaſons then theſe. It feeds the fire, it nouriſheth the fleſh, and it aſſwageth paine: Therefore it is light, meat and medicine. Behold now the ſame things in the name of the bridegroome: It giues light being preached, it feeds being ſtudied vpon; and being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon, it lenifieth and aſſwageth. And let vs briefely runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euerie one of theſe: Whereof I pray you ſprang ſo great and ſo ſodaine a light ouer all the world, but by the preaching of the name of Ieſus? Neither is the name of Ieſus onely light, but alſo meate: are you not ſo often comforted as you thinke vpon it? what makes ſo fat the minde of him that muſeth often thereon, as it doth? what makes our ſenſes ſo quicke? ſtrengthens the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our ſoules: makes liuely or good and honeſt our conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: cheriſheth our chaſt affections? All the meat of the ſoule is drie, if it be not baſted with this oyle: It is vnſauorie, if it be not ſeaſoned with this ſalt. If thou write any thing, it doth not pleaſe me, vnleſſe I read Ieſus there: If thou diſpute or conferre, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me not, vnleſſe Ieſus ſounde there. Ieſus is honie in the mouth, muſicke in the eare, and ioy in the heart: but it is alſo phiſicke. Is anie amongſt vs ſorrowfull? let Ieſus come into his mind, and let it leape vp into his mouth, and behold as ſoone as you ſhall name him, light ſhall ſpring, all clouds ſhall be diſperſt, and faire ſunſhine ſhall appeare. Doth anie man fall into ſinne? nay doth he runne by deſpaire into the ſnare of death? If he ſhall call vpon this name of life, ſhall he not by and by begin to breath againe, and recouer life? What euer accuſtomed heardnes of heart, fainthearted cowardlines, cancred malice, or ſlouthfull idlenes was euer able to abide to appeare before this glorious name? who had euer the fountaine of teares dried vp, and calling on the name of Ieſus did not burſt out againe more plentifully and flowed more ſweetly? Who euer now quaking and trembling in daungers, this name of power being called vpon, did not by and by receiue courage and repell all feare? Who euer wauering and boiling in doubts calling vpon this glorious name, receiued not forthwith moſt aſſured reſolution and certaintie? Who euer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:25632:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> in aduerſitie and euen nowe fainting, if hee once but named this name of helpe, lacked ſtrength? And to this thing the Lord himſelfe inuites vs, when as he ſaith: <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> Nothing ſo bridles the rage of anger, aſſwageth the ſwelling of pride, heales the wound of enuie, ſtoppes the ſtreame of ryot, quencheth the flame of luſt, ſlakes the thirſt of couetouſneſſe, and vanquiſheth that tickling itching of all vncomlineſſe. For when I name Ieſus, I ſet before mine eies a moſt meeke man, humble and lowly in heart, courteous, ſober, chaſt, mercifull, and famous in all vertue and holineſſe; and the ſame alſo God omnipotent, who heales mee with his example, and ſtrengthens me with his arme. Therefore I take from him examples to follow, as he is a man; and helpe to leane and truſt vnto in all my troubles, as he is God: theſe as Apothecaries ſtuffe; this as the ſtrength and vertue of them. And I make thereof ſuch a confection as no Phyſition in the world is able to make.

So that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the clemencie, and mercie of our Sauiour gaue opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to thoſe wicked perſons, of accuſing him.

The which that we may better vnderſtand, wee muſt know that there are two manner of waies of prayſing God: One with wordes; another with workes. The phyſition with words commends the treacle he hath made, and ſaith that it is of great force againſt all poyſon: but he commends it in deed, who being ſtricken of a Scorpion, takes his treacle and is healed by it. Thou ſeeſt how this ſecond kind of praiſing is better then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The one praiſeth it in hope, the other in deed: the praiſe of the one conſiſts in words; but of the other in workes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as much difference as there is betweene ſaying and doing; ſo great difference is there alſo betweene thoſe two manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</p>
                     <p>But faith praiſeth the goodneſſe and mercie of God, after the ſecond manner, when as ſhe being in the midſt of perils and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſhe is ſecure and triumpheth. Through this aſſurance ſhe vndertakes great and hard matters; and ſhe diſtributes to the poore that ſhe hath, without any care, hoping with aſſurance in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, which neuer forſakes them which truſt in him, and which enter into perils and troubles for his name ſake. There are verie fewe, although perchance otherwiſe good men, who haue attained to this ſteppe of faithfull aſſurance; but happy and thrice happy is he, that hath attained vnto it: to which this woman ſeemes to haue climbed vp; who being ſo often repelled and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the Lord; yet for all that did not diſtruſt of his goodneſſe and mercie.

                        <hi>hee writes thus out of</hi> Bernard: Of the firſt fruit or rather effect of prayer, <hi>Bernard</hi> thus ſpeakes: As often as I ſpeake of prayer, me thinkes I heare in your hearts, but as it were ſome ordinarie talke betwixt man and man, which alſo I haue heard very often of others, and ſometime tried in my ſelfe. For what a matter is this? that although we neuer ceaſe from praying, yet at any time ſcarce any one feeles what is the fruite or commoditie of his prayer. As we come to prayer; ſo we depart from prayer: as though no man anſwered vs againe, or gaue vs a word: as though no man minded any thing, but as that we haue ſeemed to haue laboured in vaine. But what ſaies the Lord in the Goſpell: <hi>Iudge not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to the outward appearance; but iudge ye the righteous iudgement.</hi> And what is the righteous iudgement? but the iudgement of faith; becauſe the <hi>iust man liues by faith:</hi> Therefore follow thou the iudgement of faith; and not thine owne experience; becauſe faith is true, but thine experience is oftentimes deceitfull. And what is the truth of faith? but that the ſonne of God himſelfe hath promiſed whatſoeuer ye ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in prayer, beleeue that you ſhall receiue it, and it ſhall be done vnto you. Let none of you (O my brethren) make light account of his praiers: For I ſay vnto you, that he to whom we pray, makes no ſmall account of it. For before it go out of our mouth, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds it to be regiſtred in his booke: And one thing of theſe two
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:25632:197"/> we may without all doubt hope for; that he will grant eyther that which we deſire; or that which he knowes to be more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for vs. For we know not to pray as we ought to pray, but he hath compaſſion of our ignorance, and receiuing our praier cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, giues vs not that which is not either profitable for vs, or is not neceſſarie to be giuen vs ſo ſoone. <hi>And againe,</hi> When we aske that which is not profitable for vs he heares vs not, but he giues vs that which is more profitable: euen as the carnall father is alſo wont to do, who when his child deſires of him both bread and the knife, he will giue him the bread, but not the knife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This aſſurance we ſhould haue when we make our prayers, that God anſweres vs, &amp; granteth vs our requeſts, or elſe that which is farre better for vs: and with this truſt and aſſurance whenſoeuer we praie, we ſhould returne from praiers, not as though we had praied to a wall, or that we were not better then we were before: naie when we returne from ſpeaking to that bountifull and rich king, we muſt beleeue aſſuredlie that we returne not againe emptie; but enriched with many great and heauenlie treaſures. This aſſurance in poperie how could they haue which knewe not what they ſaide, nor for what they prayed. And againe, of Gods great willingneſſe to heare our praiers, he writes thus.</hi> It would verie greatly delight and pleaſe the mercie of God, if men were ſo readie to heare his voice, as he is to heare theirs: For it is moſt true, that we are a great deale more ſlacke in our duties, then he is in his.<note place="margin">Can. 6.12.</note> Therefore when as he cals his ſpowſe in the Canticles, he cals her foure times, &amp; he repeats the ſame word foure times: Return, returne <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> O Shulamite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, returne. But ſhe when ſhe cals her bridegroome, cals him but once, And behold he is at hand: <hi>Returne <hi>(ſaith ſhe)</hi> my beloued, be like a Roe, or a young Hart vpon the mountaines of Bether.</hi>

And ſuch (O my God) when they ſhall ſee that thou wilt forgiue me my ſinnes, ſhall be ouercome and aſhamed of their iudgements: And they ſhall acknowledge that which thou ſpakeſt by thy Prophet; that is, <hi>As high as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens are exalted from the earth; ſo are thy waies farre aboue the waies of men, and thy thoughts aboue their thoughts.</hi> Therefore (O Lord) haue mercie vpon me and blot out mine iniquitie. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Granatenſis.</p>

                        <hi>And after of the praiers of the faithfull, he writes thus:</hi> What ſhal I ſay, O Lord, of thy readines in hearing the praiers of the iuſt; what of thy ſpeedines in fulfilling their deſires? how often doeſt thou promiſe vs this in thy holy ſcriptures, that thou mighteſt take away our infidelity &amp; diſtreſſe? In a certain place thou ſaieſt, which of you askes bread of his father, and will he giue him a ſtone? our askes fiſh, and will he for fiſh giue him a ſerpent? or if he aske an
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:25632:199"/> egge, will he reach him a Scorpion? If ye therefore when as ye are euill, know to giue good things to your children: how much more ſhall your heauenly father from heauen giue his holy ſpirit to them which aske him. And in another place: Aske and it ſhal be giuen to you: ſeeke and ye ſhall finde, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you. But the words of our Lord which are in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell, doe declare the ſame much more manifeſtly: by which it is manifeſt, that God hath at once opened to his friends all the gates of his mercie, when as he ſaith, If you abide in me and my words abide in you, aske whatſoeuer ye will, and it ſhall be done vnto you. Could the heart of man (if a wiſh were giuen him to wiſh whatſoeuer he would) haue wiſhed a more large or greater benefit? when as in theſe words he hath leaue giuen him, to aske whatſoeuer he will. And he giues his word alſo that whatſoeuer he asketh, he ſhall obtaine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the promiſes of the Goſpell: from which they alſo diſagree not which are found euerie where amongſt the Prophets. The Pſalmiſt ſaith in a certaine place, he will doe the will of them that feare him, and he will heare their prayer, and will ſaue them. And in another place: The eies of the Lord are vpon the iuſt, and his eares are open vnto their prayers. And in another place, hee ſaith: He hath regarded the prayer of the humble, and hath not deſpiſed their petition. <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo ſings the ſame ſong to vs. For after he had ſhewed with what good works, God is eſpecially ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by and by he addeth the reward that ſhall be giuen to them that ſerue him, ſaying: Then he ſhall call, and the Lord ſhall heare him: he ſhal crie, and the Lord ſhal ſay: Behold, here am I. And as though this were but a ſmall thing; thou thy ſelfe O Lord, addeſt a farre greater, and more bountifull promiſe in the ſame Prophet, ſaying: And it ſhall come to paſſe, that before they ſhall call I will anſwere, and while they yet ſpeake, I will heare. Hee muſt needs be very hard harted and ſtarke blind, who is not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with ſuch words and promiſes, that he may conſider and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the great mercie and goodneſſe, which thou vſeſt towards thy ſeruants. And who would not willingly ſuffer any thing that he might be accounted in the number of them, &amp;c. <hi>To make interceſſors to God, what is it, but to doubt of theſe promiſes, both of the Prophets and of the Goſpell? then to doubt of this readineſſe of God, which</hi> Granatenſis <hi>here teacheth to heare our

                        <hi>And after,</hi> Great is the loue wherewith fathers loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and yet the fathers tender heart will not ſuffer that the ſonne that hath married againſt his will, or hath done any ſuch like fault ſhould once come into his ſight. But yet the tender mercie of this our heauenly father, although a man haue done vnto him, all the iniuries that can be deuiſed, if he returne to him with all his heart, doth not deſpiſe him, but receiues him as he did the prodigall ſon, forgiuing all his treſpaſſes and faults. The prophet knew this when as he ſaid: O Lord thou art our father, <hi>Abraham</hi> is ignorant of vs, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> knowes vs not: but thou O Lord art our father, and our redeemer, and thy name is from euerlaſting. This thy loue O Lord ſprings of thy goodneſſe: from which proceede two moſt profitable ſtreames, that is, thy mercie, and thy loue: the one that our infirmities might be cured; and the other, that thy good things might be imparted to vs. If therefore this thy fountaine be infinit; what ſhall the floud of loue be, that proceeds from it? Therefore I neither fear, nor am affraid, nor diſtruſt: although I acknowledge my ſelfe to be a ſinner, &amp; ſo vnworthy to be beloued. For how fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſoeuer I am, he that loues me is good; &amp; ſo good, that he wil not reiect ſinners: yea he cals them vnto him, he receiues them and eates with them. To all theſe tokens and works of thy loue, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is added: O Lord, becauſe thou art loue it ſelfe, thy Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt witneſſeth this, when as he ſaith: God is charitie, and he that dwelleth in charitie, dwelleth in God, and God in him.

For hereof depends all the force and fruit of prayer: for in Gods eares, as <hi>Bernard</hi> witneſſeth, an earneſt deſire is a great cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:25632:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> and a colde or ſlothfull minde and intention, is a low voice: for his eares are open rather to the voice of the heart, then to the voice of the body. By this it may be plainly perceiued, how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and fruitleſſe the prayers of ſome men are, as well cleargie as lay-men, which with ſuch haſte and ſpeed runne ouer their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Pſalmes, that they ſeeme not at all to talke with God. For they would not deale ſo negligently and careleſly with man, if they had any thing that they would earneſtly obtaine at his hands.

For if they knew that they talked with that ſame great maieſtie, at whoſe preſence the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe tremble, and that they make ſuite vnto him, concerning that weightie matter, that is, the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, and the ſaluation of their ſoules: then they would open their eies, and they would perceiue what an vnſeemely, nay what an vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing it were, that they ſhould ſpeake to ſuch a Lord of ſo weightie matters, ſo negligently; yea to talke with him ſo, as they would not talke with their ſeruant, if they would haue him doe any thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saint</hi> Bernard <hi>reprooues them couertly when he ſaith,</hi> I ſay this (to be briefe) that ſome finde in their prayers when they pray, a certaine lumpiſhneſſe and dulneſſe of the minde, that praying onely with their lippes, they neither marke well what they ſpeake, nor with whom they ſpeake; becauſe they come to prayer as it were of cuſtome,<note place="margin">Ber. in Epiſt.</note> with ſmall reuerence or care. Therfore as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth vs to be watchfull in all our actions; ſo eſpecially in our prayers: For although (<hi>as the ſame</hi> Bernard <hi>ſaith</hi>) the eies of the Lord doe behold vs at all times, and in all places, but eſpecially in our prayers. For although we be ſeene euer, but then we preſent our ſelues before the maieſtie of God, and doe talke with him as it were face to face. <hi>And in another place he ſaith:</hi> It is daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous if thy prayer be fearefull, without faith; more dangerous if it be raſh, without reuerence; but the third and moſt dangerous, if
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:25632:201"/> it be key cold as we ſay, and come not from a liuely affection. For a fearefull prayer cannot pearce the heauens, becauſe ouer great feare reſtraines the minde, that the prayer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcend, nay not come out. A key cold or faint prayer vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away &amp; periſheth, when it ſhould aſcend, becauſe it lacketh force. A raſh prayer aſcends truly, but it rebounds back againe: for God reſiſts it; neither doth it obtaine grace, but deſerues puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But that prayer which is faithfull, humble, and feruent ſhall, without all doubt, pearce into the heauens. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt certaine, it cannot returne emptie. <hi>Thus farre out of</hi> Bernard.</p>

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:25632:203"/> heare the plowman holding his plough, ſinging <hi>Alleluiah.</hi> And the ſweating ſhearer comforted himſelfe with Pſalmes, and the vinedreſſer pruning his vine with his ſharpe hooke did ſing ſome of <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes.

All theſe like Bees, ſaith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> hauing in their hands the waxe of their worke, but in their mouth drops of honie, when as with their owne ſinging voices they did praiſe the Lord of all things, and did pray vnto him. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Michael ab Iſſelt. <hi>This was the eſtate of the Primitiue Church.

The one is a well, a ſtreame ſpringing into euerlaſting life: a comforter, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie like water comforts in all the heats and broyles of this life: as our ſauiour teacheth.

And ſo no doubt by this his owne example, he hath taught all men what opinion (if they will not be wilfull) euery one ſhould haue of his writings &amp; expoſitions. So that then in the time of popery, the ſhepheards the paſtors of congregations, in not giuing this meat vnto their flocks, in not healing their woundes &amp; ſores, with the leaues of theſe trees, in not preaching the word of God, they haue declared themſelues not be <hi>Chriſts ſhepheards;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Io. 10.10.</note> but to be Antichriſts hirelings.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:25632:207"/> Is not this quite to teare in péeces the verie hoofes and clawes of the poore ſillie lambes? whereby they began now to go and to lay hold on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this ſame Author ſaith: <hi>That now one hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch a faithfull and holy confeſſor, let him account of him euen as of God himſelfe,</hi> and reueale to him boldly all <hi>his ſecret ſins and all the ſecrets of his heart.</hi> And is not this plainly to ſay that the Pope is Antichriſt?

                        <hi>and then ſhall euerie man haue praiſe of God.</hi> And to <hi>Timothie. <hi>Some mens ſinnes are open before hand, and goe before vnto iudgement; but ſome mens follow after.</hi>
                        </hi> But the papiſts by this their doctrine contrarie to ſaint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine in both theſe places, doe make their confeſſors to take vpon them that knowledge of ſecrets which belongs to God, and that no ſinnes are to be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto the daie of iudgement. Their confeſſors (if men will not be damned) (as they teach) muſt knowe them before.</p>
                     <p>This author here himſelfe confeſſeth: that to know the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the heart belongs onely to God.

But he not without griefe of minde and voice, groned out and ſaid: <hi>Are you affraid to ſuffer, will you not depart hence:</hi> what ſhall I do to you? Our brother being at the point of death, heard what he ſhould ſay to others: for he which heard it, being nowe dying, heard it to this end, that he ſhould ſhew it to others: he heard it not for himſelfe, but for others, &amp;c. <hi>And after he writes thus:</hi> To vs our ſelues, the leaſt and baſeſt of all others: how often hath it bin reuolued, how often and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the grace of God commaunded: that I ſhould diligently and humbly preach and proteſt, that our brethren are not to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that by the Lords calling are deliuered out of this world; when as I know that they are not loſt, but ſent before; and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from vs, that they go before vs. And that as going a iourney or ſayling, we ſhould long for them: we ſhould not lament them: neither that we ſhould here weare mourning garments for them, when as they there haue taken white garments. And that we ſhould not giue occaſion to the Gentiles, that they may iuſtly and rightly reprooue vs; that we ſhould lament thoſe as extinct or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, whom we affirme to be aliue with the Lord, and that we ſhould reprooue, with the teſtimonie of our heart and mindes, the faith which wee profeſſe with our tongues and voice. We our ſelues ſin againſt our owne hope and faith: all the things we ſay, ſeems but faigned, forged &amp; counterfaited: It auaileth nothing in
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:25632:210"/> wordes to tattle of vertue, and with deeds to deſtroy the truth. S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo reprooues, and chides, and blames thoſe, that are ſorie for the departure of their friends. He affirmes that thoſe are ſory for their friends departure which haue no hope: but we which liue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hope, and beleeue in God, and beleeue that Chriſt ſuffered for vs and roſe againe: we beleeue that thoſe that remaine in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall riſe again by him and in him. Why will not we our ſelues depart out of this world, or why doe we deplore and lament our friends departing, as though they were periſhed? Our Lord Chriſt admoniſhing vs &amp; ſaying, I am the reſurrection: he that beleeues in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he liue. And all that liues and beleeues in me, ſhall not die for euer. If we beleeue in Chriſt, let vs beleeue his words and promiſes, and we ſhall not die for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: that we may come to Chriſt ioyfully, and without care; with whom we ſhall liue and raigne. That in the meane time we die; by death, we paſſe to immortalitie: neither can immortalitie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, vnleſſe we depart hence firſt. Death is not a going out of the doores: but a paſſage from a worſe place to a better. And an earthly iourney being ended, as an arriuall to things eternall, who will not haſten to obtaine theſe things which are better? Who will not wiſh the ſooner to be changed and to be made like the forme and ſhape of Chriſt, to come to the dignitie of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? as S. <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth, our conuerſation is in heauen, <hi>3.

                        </hi> The teachers <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> teach heauenlie things, the hearers according to their pleaſures, chuſe that which they think is to be done. But in the day of the comming of the Lord there ſhall be a ſharpe and vehement examination, &amp; thoſe which haue liued well, as gold and ſiluer, the fire ſhall make more bright. And it ſhall burne them which haue liued euill, like wood, hay, or ſtubble. The teacher alſo which hath taught ſuch things as became him, ſhall not ſuffer puniſhment: but ſhall be accounted worthie of ſaluation <hi>(for this he ſaith)</hi> but he ſhall be ſaued: that is the teacher. The worke ſhall be burned: that is as much to ſay: they who haue made themſelues as euill worke. <hi>And after.</hi>) If anie will not applie that (as it were by fire) to the worke: but to the teacher, let him ſo vnderſtand it that he ſhal not ſuffer puniſhment for them: but he alſo ſhall be &amp; ſaued tried by fire, if he haue a life agreeing with the doctrine. <hi>Thus much</hi> Theodoret, <hi>whereby it appeares plainly that he expoundes this place not of anie purgatorie fire before the day of iudgement: but of the fire which at that day ſhall be reuealed.

                        <hi>The text it ſelfe ſéemes to prooue manifeſtly, that by this fire is meant afflictions. For thus we reade: <hi>Euerie mans worke ſhall be made manifest: for the day ſhall make it manifeſt: for through fire it ſhall be reuealed: and euerie ones worke what kind of one it ſhal be the fire ſhall trie.</hi> No doubt fire in all theſe places is taken in the ſame ſignification. But it is manifeſt that as Chriſt ſaid of the ſéed of his word, the Sunne ariſing, that is, the heate of perſecution tries whether the ſeed had taken déepe roote or not: ſo fire here reueales euerie ones worke, that is, perſecutions and afflictions. This fire ſhall diſcloſe and make things hid, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; which the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of: it ſhall trie workes: but ſuch a fire is not the fire of purgatory. It diſcloſeth nothing: nay it is hid it ſelfe. Neither doth it trie workes, as this fire the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of doeth: but it purgeth ſoules, as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts teach. And therefore this place can make nothing for their purgatorie fire. The verie text it ſelfe refutes it. M.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>and</hi> Poligranes <hi>expound that place of</hi> Matthew. Agree with thine aduerſarie, of purgatorie. <hi>Wherof</hi> Poligranes <hi>writes thus:</hi> There are manie other places of ſcripture,<note place="margin">Polig. de ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag. defunct. De Purg. lib. 1. ca. 4.</note> out of which as concerning this matter the fathers ſay nothing; yet our later writers being ſtirred vp by heretiques, &amp; ſearching the ſcriptures more diligently, do from them confirme purgatorie, of which ſort is this: <hi>Agree with thine aduerſarie. <hi>And Maſter</hi>
                        </hi> Bellarmine <hi>affirmes</hi> that they all agree that the priſon is hell. But yet there are many manſions, ſome
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:25632:213"/> for the damned, and ſome for them which ſhall be purged.</p>
                     <p>Againe, almoſt all agree, that by the laſt farthing are meant ſmall ſinnes. Againe, that vntill thou haſt paide the laſt farthing, cannot ſeeme rightly to be ſaid, vnleſſe there were an end of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither Saint <hi>Auſtens</hi> examples are ſufficient to prooue the contrarie. For when it is ſaid, he knewe her not vntill ſhee had brought foorth; we may not hereby gather that he knewe her after; but we may wel inferre, that ſhe ſhould ſometime bring foorth: So likewiſe when it is ſaid, Sit thou on my right hand till I put, &amp;c. it may verie well hereof be gathered, that all Chriſts enemies ſomtime ſhal be put vnder his feet; otherwiſe, that <hi>vntill</hi> were vnfitly ſaid. So alſo when it is ſaid; Thou ſhalt not go out till thou haſt paide the vttermoſt farthing, we may very wel inferre: Therfore ſometime he ſhal pay the vttermoſt farthing and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſhall go out from thence.</p>

                        <hi>But</hi> Stella <hi>of this place writes farre otherwiſe then M.</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine: The iudge ſhall giue thee to the Iaylor.<note place="margin">In 12. Luc.</note> The ſentence ſhall be pronounced of Chriſt the iudge, and the wicked man ſhall be deliuered to the Iaylor, that he may puniſh him; becauſe the ſinner ſhall be deliuered to the Diuell to be puniſhed. For the Lord ſaith to the wicked: Go ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the Diuell and his angels, &amp;c. And the Iaylor caſt thee into priſon, that is, into hell. Of which priſon <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes: They ſhall be ſhut in priſon. And leſt he ſhould deſpiſe this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thinking it to be a light matter, he addes the grieuouſneſſe of it, ſaying: I ſay vnto thee, Thou ſhalt not go out thence till thou haue paide the vttermoſt farthing. Thinke not that hee ſhall ſometimes come out: For this word <hi>vntill</hi> in the holy ſcriptures ſignifies eternitie of times: whence we haue it thus written in the Pſalme. The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand till I put thine enemies, &amp;c. And yet it is moſt certaine, that Chriſt our Sauiour ſits in the excellent good things of his father for euer and euer. Secondly, this place may be expounded properly, as it foundeth: Becauſe thou ſhalt not go out till thou haſt paide the vttermoſt farthing, and yet after thou ſhalt go out. But thou ſhalt neuer go out: For one can neuer come to the end of a thing that is without end. But the puniſhment of hell for continuance of time is without ende: and therefore a man can neuer come to the end of his paiment. So is meant that of the Pſalme, Iuſtice ſhall
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:25632:214"/> ſpring in his daies, and abundance of peace as long as the moone endureth; that is, till ſhe ſhall ceaſe to be in heauen, and yet ſhe ſhall neuer ceaſe to bee in heauen: therefore that peace ſhall neuer faile: So the wicked ſhall bee in hell vntill they haue paide the vttermoſt farthing. The which becauſe they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pay, it is moſt certaine that they ſhall bee there for euer.</p>

                        <hi>What do they, which are baptized for the dead, if the deadriſe not againe, why are they baptized for them?</hi> This place <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> plainely prooues that, which we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if it be rightly vnderſtood. And <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> that there are ſixe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of this place. <hi>And he concludes thus:</hi> That the ſixt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true, &amp; the natural meaning of the place, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of the baptiſme of teares &amp; repentance, which is a accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by praying, faſting, and giuing of almes, &amp;c. That this may be the meaning, what do they which are baptized ouer the dead, if the dead riſe not againe? that is, what do they which pray, faſt, ſigh and afflict themſelues for the dead, if the dead riſe not againe? <hi>And ſo do <hi>Ephrem</hi> in his teſtament, and</hi> Petrus Cluniacenſis

                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> Gagneius <hi>of this place writes thus:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gag. in 1. Cor. cap. 15.</note> Diuers men of this place bring diuers iudgements: I thinke that there may be two meanings of this place. The firſt, whereunto <hi>Chryſostome</hi> agrees: If the dead riſe not againe, what do they which are baptized for the dead, that is, for the hope of the dead? For as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> ſaith, in the primitiue Church they which were to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, repeated the whole Creed, wherein is this place: <hi>I beleeue the reſurrection of the dead:</hi> In which hope of riſing againe from the dead, they were baptized, which otherwiſe would neuer haue bin baptized, and haue changed their olde life; vnleſſe they hoped that they ſhould ariſe to an immortall life. And this is that which <hi>Paul</hi> cals to be baptized for the dead. Or elſe becauſe that <hi>Paul</hi> taught the faithfull, that to be baptized, was nothing elſe then through the ſpirit and water to die with Chriſt, and to be buried with him, that being buried with him they might alſo riſe againe with him, if after the maner of his death they were grafted into him, as he teacheth in the ſixt to the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: And therfore he ſaith, what do they which are baptized, that is, which die in Chriſt to the olde man, and their accuſtomed delights are buried with him for dead, that is, for the hope which they haue of riſing again from the dead. Me thinkes alſo there may be another ſenſe of this place, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme may be taken for affliction &amp; puniſhment: As Chriſt ſaith to the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> the 10. of <hi>Marke: Can you be baptized with the baptiſme that I am baptized withall?</hi> that is, ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which I ſhall ſuffer. By this meanes then this ſhould be the meaning: what do they which are baptized, that is, which are afflicted for the dead, that is, either for the hope of the dead, and of riſing againe to a life immortall; or for the dead, that is, for the teſtifying of the reſurrection of the dead, for the which the martyrs did not doubt to ſuffer death. <hi>This is all that</hi> Gagneius <hi>ſaith. And in neither of his two latter expoſitions, he affirmes that which M.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>would haue him, that they afflicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to do the dead good in purgatorie, but rather to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues good, in hope that there ſhould be a reſurrection, or elſe to ſuffer death for the trueth of the doctrine of the reſurrection, as the martyrs did.</hi>

If baptiſme here were taken for the works of repentance, done for the ſaluation of them which are in purgatorie, it ſhould haue béene vſed rather actiuely: And S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſhould haue ſaid; what do they which baptize themſelues, which pray and faſt for the dead, and not what do they which are baptized of others.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo ſéemes to expound this commandement thus:<note place="margin">Eſay, 40.18.</note> 
                        <hi>To whom will yee liken God, and what likeneſſe will you make for him? The workman hath made an Image, and the goldſmith hath couered it with gold, and melts chaines of ſiluer for it. The poore man alſo for an oblation chuſeth a tree that will not rot, and he wil ſeeke for a cunning workeman to make him a grauen Image that cannot mooue it ſelfe. Will you not know? will ye not heare? hath it not been ſhewed to you from the beginning? will ye not vnderſtand it by the foundations of the earth? He that ſits vpon the ſpheare of the earth, and the dwellers thereof are like <hi>Locuſtes,</hi> ſtretcheth out the heauens like a webbe, and ſpreads them out as a
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:25632:218"/> tent to dwell in: God, who brings the rulers of the earth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and makes the iudges like a thing of nought; yea they haue not been planted, they haue not been ſowen; yea he hath not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their ſtocke to take roote in the earth, and he hath but blowen vpon them with his ſpirit and they haue withered away, and the whirlewinde doth take them away like ſtubble. And to whom will ye liken me, and I ſhall be like to him, ſaith the holy one?</hi> The Prophet here ſéemes to expound the commandement: and therefore he ſaith, hath it not been declared to you from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? will ye not yet vnderſtand that ſame olde and firſt commandement? And here he condemns not only poore mens Images, made in the honor of God of wood, but rich mens alſo of gold: naie by the wonderfull works of God, he prooues that they can make no Image like to him. And therefore their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are not onlie againſt the commandement, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon. And yet for all theſe ſpeeches and reaſons, the Papiſts <hi>will not know thus much at this day.</hi> They which paint God like a iudge ſitting in iudgment, or like a king ſitting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his throne, doe diſhonor and diſgrace the Maieſtie of God. All the iudges and kings of the world are nothing vnto him; as the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> here teacheth vs: and yet thus haue the papiſts painted him.</p>
                     <p>And yet <hi>Stella</hi> in another place plainly affirmes, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges diſtract manie times the mindes of men,<note place="margin">In cap. 2. Luc.</note> and hinder deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that to take anie part of Gods glorie from him, is flat ſacriledge: he would faine defend their Images, and yet in truth he condemnes them. For thus he writes: <hi>Marke</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that oftentimes it chanceth, that men going into houſes or Churches, are diſtracted and let by pictures and Images, and ſuch like: but Chriſt being borne in a baſe cottage, would haue no pompe, that we ſhould marke and behold him alone. For exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall trimming and decking is wont to diſtract the mindes, that ſometimes it lookes here, and ſometimes there, that being neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which moſt chiefly was to be looked vnto. But Chriſt in his natiuitie was poore and baſe, becauſe that he would haue nothing but himſelfe to be conſidered. Stella</hi> here plainly confeſſeth, that images oftentimes diſtract mens minds, and hinder deuotion, &amp; that in Bethleem where Ieſus Chriſt was borne, there were no images or pictures, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt alone ought
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:25632:218"/> to be conſidered and marked. I would to God our Catholikes and Ieſuits at this daie, would alſo obſerue this leſſon, that in Bethleem in the Church, where as now alſo Ieſus Chriſt is <hi>daily borne,</hi> they would haue no images,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.15.</note> and that they would conſider and marke Ieſus Chriſt alone.</p>
                     <p>And againe in the ſame place vpon theſe words: <hi>Glorie to God on high,</hi> he writes thus: <hi>By which place we muſt learne, in all things and chances whatſoeuer, to giue glorie to God alone: neither let that thought euer come into thy minde, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt violently take that from him, becauſe that then thou ſhalt be moſt grieuouſly puniſhed. For in euerie good thing thou doeſt, two things are to be conſidered: the praiſe or honour, and the profit: whereof God chuſeth the honor as due to himſelfe; but the profit or gaine, he reſerues for thee. Therefore if thou ſhalt with a wicked &amp; violent hand, take away the honor due to God; God will alſo take from thee the reward, which alſo was thine. Therefore if thou ſhalt doe this hainous act, thou ſhalt not only be worthy to haue no gift giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee of God; but he wil moſt ſeuerely puniſh thee. So the Angell ſtrooke <hi>Herod,</hi> as we read in the Acts, becauſe he gaue not the honour vnto God. For it is plaine theft and robberie not to giue God his proper honor; no leſſe then to ſteale any veſſell of ſiluer from thy neighbour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And a little after: <hi>That ſame holy <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when as his vnchaſt Lady did entiſe him to ſinne, ſaid thus: My Lord hath giuen me al things beſides thee, which art his wife: how then dare I ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Lord? So God hath giuen thee all things beſides his glorie, which is as it were his wife; how then dareſt thou ſin againſt thy Lord God, in taking from him his glorie?</hi> Thus far <hi>Stella.</hi> It is of all ſins a moſt hainous ſin, in anie part to impaire Gods glory.

                     <p>It was not <hi>the power or holineſſe of Peter</hi> that healed that lame man, but it was <hi>the power and might of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſo no doubt the ſame power wrought all miracles after in the primitiue Church. The glorie of all thoſe miracles belonged to Ieſus Chriſt: For ſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here teſtifieth; <hi>The God of our fathers hath glorified his ſon Ieſus.</hi> No part of the glorie of them appertained, either to the Apoſtles, or Martyrs following: as <hi>Peter</hi> here plainlie teacheth.</p>

                        </hi> ſo in the age ſuccéeding, the people began to reuerence the Martyrs, and to acknowledge that by their vertues partly, theſe miracles were wrought.<note place="margin">Aug. de cura pro mortuis agenda cap. 1.</note> And a proofe hereof is, that <hi>a widow burying her ſon neere to a Martyr, asked <hi>Paulinus</hi> iudgement, and he S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> counſell: whether ſuch a buriall were not profitable to the ſoule of her ſonne or no.</hi> And this queſtion (as ſhould ſeeme) gaue an occaſion to S. <hi>Auſten</hi> of writing that booke.

If this firſt leſſon had béen taught and firmely obſerued in the Church; ſo much ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reuerence, &amp; inuocation of the ſaints departed, would neuer haue crept into the Church, as hath done.

                        <hi>I am the Lord thy God. <hi>As though he ſhould ſay, I euen I, I ſay, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I am the Lord thy gouernour, thy God and thy Creator al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who as I haue created thee; ſo I gouerne thee: not thou thy ſelfe by thine owne wiſedome, ſtrength or righteouſnes, &amp;c. I beſtow benefits vpon thee, I redeeme thee from euils, ſinne and damnation. In my power are all things, which made all things. And how great ſoeuer I am, I am wholy thine; and in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:25632:220"/> I am able: Onely remember thou, that onely thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me to be ſuch a one, and ſuffer me to be thy God, that is, that thou looke for all good things of me; in all thy euils, thou looke vpon me; neither that thou turne thine eies anie other way or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie thy heart. Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods: that is, haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides me, in which thou maiſt truſt: vſe the creatures; ſet not thy heart vpon them, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi> Here is an notable platforme of Chriſtianitie to beléeue that God is wholy ours, to looke for all things from him, in all daungers to flie to him, neuer to turne our eies from him. Thus ſaith <hi>Ferus.</hi> Agréeing here with <hi>Dauid:</hi>

                        <hi>Euen as the eies of ſeruants looke vnto the hands of their maiſters; &amp; as the eies of a maiden to the hands of her miſtres: ſo our eies wait vpon the Lord our God till he haue mercie vpon vs.</hi> Seruants muſt not haue wandring eies: they muſt ſtedfaſtly attend vpon their maiſters, that they may be readie to do their pleaſures; ſo muſt all Gods ſeruants haue their eies fixed vpon him; neither turne to anie other in his ſeruice in their afflictions and daungers, euen vntill he haue mercie vpon them. If this platforme of Chriſtianity were printed in euerie Chriſtian heart, they néeded no Images to put them in minde of God: God ſhould be euer before their eies: They néed no interceſſors to God: God is wholy theirs: who then dare doubt of his loue?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> of the honour of the ſaints writes thus: <hi>There be ſome which attribute too much to the ſaints:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fer. in Mat. ca. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>And againe there are ſome which attribute nothing vnto them. But here thou maiſt ſee that Chriſt praiſeth <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that excellently, euen to our inſtruction: but he praiſeth <hi>Iohn</hi> ſo, as he preferres himſelfe before <hi>Iohn.</hi> So I ſay, the ſaints are to be praiſed, who are worthie of praiſe both in their liues, and alſo in their deaths; and that which is worthie of praiſe in them, is to be highly commended, to the edification of others: but yet they are ſo to be praiſed as that they be neither preferred, nor made equall with Chriſt, but that they be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to him. They are to be praiſed as members of Chriſt, as friends, as ſeruants, as veſſels, and inſtruments of the glorie of God. It is praiſe enough to be a member and ſeruant of Chriſt. The bleſſed Virgine was content with this: Behold</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>the handmaide of the Lord. And in her ſong ſhe ſaith: <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord.</hi> Neither will ſhe haue any thing commended in her
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:25632:220"/> then Gods fauour and gifts. So <hi>Paul</hi> in all places brags of this: That he is the ſeruant of Chriſt. So alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt witneſſeth of himſelfe: Hee that hath the bride, is the bridegroome: but the friende of the bridegroome reioyceth to heare the bridegroome ſpeake. As though he ſhould ſay; that is not to be attributed to me, which belongs onely to Chriſt. I am verie well contented, that I am the friend of the bridegroome: neither do I attribute any other thing to my ſelfe; neither will I that any other attribute any other thing to me.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> Where he toucheth thoſe that giue too much to ſaints: And who be thoſe; but the papiſts? And he couertly expounds what he meanes by giuing too much to ſaints: That is (ſaith he) <hi>In making them equall with Chriſt; in ioyning them togither with him in his office, either of redemption or ſauing vs, or of his mediation; in making them meanes betweene God and vs:</hi> As ſome Catholicks haue done and taught; ioyning the bloud of <hi>Thomas</hi> to Chriſts bloud, in their ſaluation. This no doubt <hi>Ferus</hi> liked not, and wée muſt learne here, leaſt we do honor the ſaints too much, which here by <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement we may not do, as ſome euen now do. The verie heathen were of this opinion, that all glorie was to be giuen to the Gods. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Athenians wondering at, and honouring one called <hi>Pytho,</hi> becauſe he had ſlaine <hi>Cottis:</hi>

                        <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>we muſt thanke the gods, who are the authors of this noble act, they haue onely borrowed my helpe and hand.</hi> If a heathen confeſſed thus of his workes, much more ought a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>And euen <hi>Diogenes</hi> condemned Images.<note place="margin">Plut. de tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitate animi</note> I iudge that ſaying of <hi>Diogenes</hi> worthie of al memorie, who when he ſaw in Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia, a ſtranger adorning himſelfe vpon an holiday: <hi>What</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>to a good man euerie day is an holiday: nay if we were wiſe a great holiday. For this world is a moſt holy Church, and moſt meet for God: And man when he is borne, is admitted into this Church, not to behold Images made with hands and void of ſenſe; but rather the Sun, the Moone, &amp; the Stars; from which the beginnings of life &amp; motions do proceed, which Gods prouidence hath giuen vs to behold, that theſe ſenſible things ſhould be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of thoſe things which are vnderſtood, and imitations or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of them as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid.</hi> The verie blind Phyloſopher ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the darke, at that which the Apoſtle teacheth. That the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:25632:221"/> 
                        <hi>Inuiſible things of God are ſeene being vnderſtood by the creation of the world,</hi>

                        <hi>and by thoſe things which God hath made.</hi> Theſe are the liuelieſt Images of God. And herein this blind Philoſopher came néerer the marke, then the papiſts who make ſtocks and ſtones (which he condemned) Images of God.</p>
                     <p>Of the honour due to the ſaints, <hi>Ferus</hi> writes thus. <hi>It is the holy Ghoſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that by the ſaints works all good things;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fer. in ca. 7. act.</note> 
                        <hi>yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes by them, as by an Organ or inſtrument: wherefore ſo the ſaints are to be praiſed, that in the end all the honour may redound to God. And therefore the kingly Prophet ſaid, <hi>Praiſe God in his ſaints.</hi>
                        </hi> The prayſe belongs to the muſition, not to the inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Fer. in 19. ca. act.</note>And againe in another place: <hi>It is expreſſely put downe here that the Lord did miracles, &amp;c. leaſt any ſhould attribute them to ſaints, or leaſt that any ſhould haue reſpect onely to the ſaints, and not to God himſelfe: As the Iewes did, who more wondered at <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was raiſed from the dead againe, then they maruelled at Chriſt, who raiſed him vp againe. Marke here alſo, that by the garments and handkerchiefs of <hi>Paul,</hi> God did worke miracles: againſt thoſe which do attribute all the miracles of ſaints vnto the diuell. That which God is ſaid to haue done heere, hee could alſo, and hath often done at the toombs &amp; reliques of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Let vs be thankefull therfore to God with mouth and worke: Let him do good vnto vs, by what meanes ſoeuer pleaſeth him: yea let vs embrace and wonder at his goodnes, who doth vs good by ſo manie meanes.</hi> God doth the miracles, and not the ſaints, ſaith <hi>Ferus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> of the honouring of ſaints writes thus. <hi>It is not euill to behold and looke vpon the Apoſtles and other godly men. For <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the lame man looke vpon vs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fer. in ca 3. act.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c. but that is euill, to ſticke onely in the ſaints; and to attribute to them thoſe things which belong to God. There be ſome which thinke that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not honour the ſaints too much; but thou ſeeſt here how <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth that honour, that derogateth anie thing from the honour of God: Why looke ye on vs? Behold here the minds &amp; wils of al the godly, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide that they ſhould be extolled for the gifts of God, but they attribute all things to God, &amp; ſo they moue God to beſtow greater things vpon them. So all flouds ſpringing from the ſea, flow thither againe, that they may plentiouſly flowe backe
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:25632:221"/> againe. God truely makes his Saints glorious and wonderfull: but contrariwiſe they aſcribe all to God. So the Angell ſaies to <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was about to worſhip him: See thou doe it not; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. So the mother of God the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> when ſhee was magnified of <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> My ſoule (ſaith ſhee) doth magnifie the Lord. Furthermore, when it is manifeſt by the ſcriptures that God works many and wonderfull things by his Saints, learne by this text how we are to deale in theſe things. Firſt, marke diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what God workes in them. Secondly, when as God vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to loue them and to dwell in them, deſpiſe not, nor raile on them. Thirdly, marke moſt diligently of all, that they are Gods inſtruments, which can doe nothing of themſelues, but doe all things from God and by God. Therefore eſpecially marke the chiefe workman and yeeld the worke to him, giue him the glorie, praiſe him in the Saints, and reuerence them chiefely in God and for Gods ſake: whereby it ſhall come to paſſe, that thou ſhalt not altogither make no account of the Saints as many do, neither ſhalt thou make them equall with God, nor ſhalt preferre them before him, which no ſmall companie doe; but both acknowledge only God by the meane of the Saints and in the Saints, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him, glorifie him.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> Wherein he doth teach vs manie notable leſſons. Firſt, not to giue to Saints thoſe things which belong to God. Secondly, that we maie honor the Saints too much; which ſome I thinke at this daie do not beléeue. Thirdly, what is the minde of all Saints: they cannot abide that they ſhould be extolled for any of Gods gifts. Fourthly, that they are but Gods inſtruments, and do nothing by their owne power: as hath been taught and beleeued moſt commonly in the darkneſſe of Poperie; when as men went a pilgrimage and offered to them; as if they of their own power could helpe them. Fiftly, let all men in all wonderfull works acknowledge God the chiefe workman: and giue him all the glorie and praiſe, and magnifie him in his Saints: as the firſt Chriſtians did in <hi>Paul;</hi> they did not magnifie <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 1.24.</note> Neither that they make anie of them equall with God.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Ferus</hi> manifeſtly refutes that ſame obiection, which the Papiſts make commonly for their pictures and images of God.<note place="margin">Fer. in 2. Act.</note> 
                        <hi>God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>hath appeared often times in many formes and ſhapes: and why may we not then paint him according to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:25632:222"/> that forme he appeared in?</hi> Here firſt beſides that this their pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing of God is manifeſtly againſt the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and againſt the doctrine of the prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> where God as it were euen reaſons with theſe idolaters,<note place="margin">Eſay 40.18.</note> and ſaith; <hi>To whom will ye liken me, &amp;c. Ferus</hi> yéelds another reaſon of theſe appearances of God. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in himſelfe is inuiſible, yet we reade that he hath oftentimes appeared. And all ſuch his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are for the moſt part, as the matters required for the which hee appeared. So <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaw God ſitting as a iudge: for the iudgement of Iſrael was at hand. He appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a buſh burning and not conſuming: For then ſuch like was the ſtate of the people of Iſrael in Egypt: for they were in the fire of aduerſitie, and were not conſumed. Alſo he ſhewed himſelfe to the eies of man at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giuing of the law in thunder, lightning, cloud, and an earthquake, to declare that that law ſhould be a fearfull lawe, and ſhould cauſe wrath. So the Angell hauing a ſword drawne in his hand, ſhewed himſelfe to <hi>Ioſuah</hi> now ready to fight; whereby he declared that he would fight againſt the enemies of the Iewes. So to <hi>Zacharie</hi> Angels appeared like horſemen: for it was a time of feare and trembling for the inuaſions of the Perſians. So the holy Ghoſt was ſeene vpon Chriſt in the ſhape of a Doue, that he might declare that ſingular and rare innocencie, puritie and mildneſſe, which was in Chriſt: For a Doue is a gentle, ſimple, and plaine creature, without any gall. So in the transfiguration of our Lord, which is a type of the reſurrection, the holy Goſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a bright cloud, that he might declare, that at the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhall want no comfort not glorie. Here alſo the holy Ghoſt appeared in toongs and fire: for the ſtate of the matter then euen ſo required it. The Apoſtles ſtood need of toongs; but both of firie and heauenly toongs.</hi> So <hi>Ferus</hi> giues theſe reaſons of theſe apparitions: and not that we ſhould by them make ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all theſe things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> alſo concerning images quite diſſents from M. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bellar. de imag. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writes thus: <hi>We with the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the images of Chriſt and the Saints are to be honoured, if ſo be that as it is declared in the councell of Trent, <hi>Seſſ. 25.</hi> we put no truſt in the images: neither that we aske any thing of them: neither that we thinke that there is any diuinitie in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And againe, anſwering after the obiection of the golden
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:25632:222"/> calfe, which the Iſraelites made, he anſweres,<note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Iſraelites thought verily that they had receiued their deliuerance out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, not of the God of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of <hi>Apis</hi> the god of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, which they had ſeene in Egypt worſhipped of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians: and therefore to him they made the image of a calfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ferus</hi> is of another and better iudgement, vpon theſe words, <hi>Make vs Gods, &amp;c.</hi> he writes thus:<note place="margin">Fer. in 7. c. Act.</note> 
                        <hi>He ſhewes that they were not only rebellious againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> but alſo againſt God. By gods here they meane</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſome worſhip of God, by which they might purchaſe his helpe. For they were not ſo blockiſh that they beleeued that <hi>Aaron</hi> could make them a god. And this prooues that which <hi>Aaron</hi> ſaid: Tomorrow is the holy day vnto the Lord: therfore they worſhipped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true God with this worſhip. The which thing is euident alſo by their owne words: Theſe are the gods, &amp;c. For they knew well enough that that calfe was not then, when they came out of Egypt: therefore no worſhip what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer pleaſeth God, which he himſelfe hath not appointed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſinned herein two waies. Firſt, in that they made an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage againſt the firſt commandement of God: Secondly, in that they worſhipped him with a worſhip deuiſed of themſelues. The true worſhip of God is in ſpirit and truth. He worſhips God which beleeues in him, truſts in him, loues him, feares him, praiſeth him, and obeyeth him. This worſhip is to be preferred aboue all others, nor any other are auailable without this. Images are therefore tolerated and borne withall in the Church, that they may put vs in minde, not that they ſhould be worſhipped: otherwiſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all be excuſed.</hi> Here <hi>Ferus</hi> quite diſſents from M. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi> Firſt he plainly affirmes, that the Iſraelites, as we doe teach, did worſhip the true God vnder the image of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calfe, and not <hi>Apis</hi> the God of the Egyptians, as M. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> affirmeth. Secondly, that images are not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped at all. And that their worſhip cannot be defended: and yet M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goeth about to defend it. Thirdly, he teacheth, that no worſhippe whatſoeuer can pleaſe God, which God himſelfe hath not ordained.</p>
                     <p>Contrarie alſo to M. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> expoſition,<note place="margin">Bell. de Imag. lib. 2 cap. 4.</note> who expounds that place of the ſecond to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> thus: <hi>I ſay ſecondly that</hi>

But <hi>Ferus</hi> plainly condemnes all worſhips of God whatſoeuer, beſides thoſe which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed himſelfe. And to this purpoſe he writes thus after vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words:<note place="margin">Fer in 7. Act.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye haue taken the Tabernacle. <hi>Moloch</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was an Idol of the Ammonites. The Iewes oftentimes deſired to ſerue God with ſtrange worſhips. So they yeelded vnto the true God the worſhippe wherewith Moloch was worſhipped of the Ammonites; in the meane while omitting that which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. So <hi>Ieroboam</hi> appointed calues; as though that had bin a more acceptable worſhip to God, then that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had preſcribed: ſo <hi>Achaz</hi> in the Temple placed an altar like that which he had ſeene at Damaſcus: ſo <hi>Achab</hi> beſides <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calues, brought in the worſhip of <hi>Baal.</hi> In that thing therefore wherein they thought greatly to pleaſe God, they greatly offended him. Therefore in the ſacrifices of God, a good meaning (as they ſay) is not ſufficient, vnleſſe it agree with the word of God. Ferus</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in teacheth vs two things: firſt that vnder the worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> the Iewes worſhipped the true God. And to this his expoſition ſéemes to agrée that place of <hi>Oſea:</hi>

                        <hi>But if you ſay vnto me, we trust in the Lord our God: Is not that he whoſe hie places and whoſe altars <hi>Ezechias</hi> hath taken away, and hath ſaid to Iudah and Ieruſalem, ye ſhall worſhip before this altar at Ieruſalem?</hi> Secondlie, that all worſhip be it neuer ſo auſtere and ſharpe in pinching themſelues, as was <hi>Baals;</hi> or ſo coſtly of gold and ſiluer, as was <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calues; or ſo ſtately in building, as was the high places, which no doubt, of their ſtatelineſſe tooke their name, can pleaſe God, if it bee not commaunded in his word, and by himſelfe ordained.</p>
                     <p>And after <hi>Ferus</hi> declares vnto vs the greateſt thing that the Diuell takes pleaſure in, and what he labours moſt about: I would to God all Catholickes would marke his leſſon, and not

                        <hi>ſo thou ſhalt find the ſaints of God to haue beene moued to anger with no ſin more then with Idolatrie. <hi>Moſes</hi> is a witnes hereof, who for this ſinne brake the tables written with Gods owne finger: <hi>Helias</hi> is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hereof, who for this ſinne ſlew many hundreds of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: <hi>Ioſias</hi> alſo, and <hi>Matathias</hi> is a witnes hereof, who ſlue <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſeruant, compelling the Iewes to Idolatrie: ſo alſo <hi>Phinees, &amp;c.</hi> For a godly man cannot patiently endure and ſee the contempt of God: And ſurely, he that can behold and endure this hath no religion in him: So <hi>Paul</hi> was greatly moued when as he ſaw the citie moſt famous for learning and religion, to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully giuen to Idolatrie. <hi>Paul</hi> had trauelled thorow many cities, yet it is reported of none of them, that they were altogether giuen to Idolatrie, but of Athens, where learned men were. So the olde prouerbe was verified: The more learned, the more wicked. So amongſt all the Iewes, the inhabitants of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were the worſt: So is it alſo now amongſt vs.</hi> And after he ſheweth what is Idolatrie, thus: <hi>Ye men of Athens. <hi>It may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the text, that the Athenians were ſtudious of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: for ſo it is ſaid before that</hi> Paul <hi>ſaw the citie giuen to Idols: And after that they erected altars to vnknowen gods. But</hi> Paul <hi>cals this worſhip not religion but ſuperſtition. Then he proues that they are not to be called Gods, which dwell in temples made with hands and ſtand need to be helped of others. Religion is one thing, and ſuperſtition is another; yet many thinke it comes to paſſe, that they which ſeeme religious to themſelues, before God are accounted nothing but ſuperſtitious.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the vnknowne God. <hi>This was the title. To the Gods of Aſia, Europe, and Africa, ſtraunge and vnknowne Gods.</hi> Paul amends this title, putting in the ſinguler number, for that which they put in the plurall: And he applies that title to the one true God, who truly is the God of Aſia, Europe, and Africa, &amp; of all the earth: but to that day vnknowen to the nations:</hi> The which you ignorantly worſhippe. <hi>This is moſt truly ſaid: For the Apoſtle did
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:25632:224"/> not preach anie new God (that which the Gentiles thought) but they ſhewed the ſame God which al the Gentiles worſhipped, not knowing him: for although they erected Images to themſelues: yet their mind was, to worſhip the true God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we may learne what a horrible ſinne Idolatrie is. Men account it as nothing: but of all ſinnes it is moſt grieuous. And let vs take héed that we incurre it not againe now by ſathans perſwaſions, with the olde Paganes. They worſhipped in their hearts the true God, to whom they made their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But that was Idolatrie ſaith <hi>Ferus.</hi> And ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like? The grieuouſnes of the ſinne ſhould make vs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie carefull, leaſt by anie meanes we ſhould come neere it.

                        <hi>Ferus</hi> writes thus: <hi>They which practiſed curious arts came and burned their bookes. True charitie reſpects not the price nor loſſe of anie thing, when ſhe ſeeth that it is contrarie to Gods commaundements. So <hi>Ezechias</hi> and <hi>Ioſias</hi> deſtroyed the Altars and Temples, although they were builded with great coſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, a little after he writes thus: <hi>For the ouerthrowing of Idolatrie, of all other things, the Apoſtles moſt ſuffered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. <hi>Diana</hi> was the Moone, which the Epheſians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped for her ſpeciall influence, which ſhe hath towards theſe earthlie things. The Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> the Goddeſſe of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians was 220. yeeres in building of all Aſia. It was 425. foot in length, 220. in breadth: It had 127. pillars in it, euerie one of them built of a king, threeſcore foot in height; whereof 36. were engrauen. To conclude, this Temple was built in a marriſh ground that it ſhould not fal with earthquakes.</hi> Here I beſéech you mark how vngodlines ſpares no expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces &amp; coſts in an euil &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious matter; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſhe is moſt niggardly to giue any thing to a good worke: there are very many ſo ſuperſtitious amongſt vs. That famous Church being ſo long in building, &amp; built with ſuch great coſt, <hi>Paul</hi> pulled down in two yéers by the word of the goſpell. Therfore great is the glorie &amp; force of the goſpell.</p>

Therefore in the hundreth and ſeuentie yeeres wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they builded their temples: they made neither carued or grauen nor painted Image.

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:25632:226"/> flight; for he is ſo mad, that he feareth no man. This victorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to God: as <hi>Ezech.</hi> ſaith in the 28. chap. vnder the name of <hi>Tyrus.</hi> And although there be no power vpon earth which may be compared to the power of the Diuel, as we read in <hi>Iob</hi> the 41. chap. yet in Chriſts preſence, all their power is cowardlineſſe. But that the Diuels ſometimes yeelde at the words of Coniurers, that plainly they doe to beguile men. If <hi>Salomon</hi> ordained exorciſmes, ſurely they were ſuch, wherein Gods praiſes and works and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were recited, which the Diuell being not able to abide, was caſt out by the power of the word of God. So <hi>Dauid</hi> plaied on his harpe before <hi>Saul,</hi> and he was better in his minde: but theſe did no ſuch things, but vſed certaine words and magicall charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and formes. And he verie excellently deſcribes them. They were Iewes <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> who had a ſpeciall commandement giuen them, that they ſhould not abuſe the name of God, and that they ſhould make no account of their magicall artes. Then they were the ſonnes of a prieſt, who ought to haue been furtheſt off from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions; but the more learned, the more wicked they were. <hi>(I coniure thee by Ieſus)</hi> marke heere that the wicked vſe good words, againſt thoſe that heereof excuſe themſelues of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, becauſe they ſay, that they vſe none but good and holy words; yea, ſo much the more they ſinne the more grieuouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they abuſe Gods word. They vſed the ſame wordes which the Apoſtles vſed; but they could doe nothing by them, becauſe they vſed exorciſmes and charmes, not of faith, vnto the glorie of God; but onely of curioſitie vnto their owne gaine.</p>

                        <hi>And leaping on them]</hi> Marke here, how Chriſt is good to the Godly: but verie terrible to the wicked and deſperate. Ferus <hi>here giues an Item or priuie nippe, to all prieſts and cleargie men. Theſe are like thoſe prieſts ſonnes, they ſhould be furtheſt off from this ſinne, and they are the chiefe practiſers of it. This is their gaine, this is their phyſicke. In our Church we haue
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:25632:226"/> found this true by experience. And after he addes:</hi> Learne out of this hiſtorie, the vertue and power of the name of Chriſt, that thou maieſt truſt in it. Secondly, take heede leaſt thou thinke or go about to driue away the Diuell, by thy owne ſtrength.

Laſtly, that correlation or mutuall reſpect, which the bridegroome here vſeth betweene thoſe ſhéepheards and thoſe ſhéepe, may plainely declare what ſhéepe he meaneth, whoſe tract we are to follow. For by thoſe ſhéepheards, no doubt he meanes the Apoſtles. And then by thoſe ſhéepe, he meanes likewiſe thoſe Chriſtians which liued in the daies of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.

They muſt haue their eares not bored, but digged thorow; they muſt be diligent and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient hearers of Gods word; and this is a principall marke of the Church: a true cogniſance of all Gods ſeruants.

So that then the firſt marke of Gods Church, is the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obedience of his word.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond marke is inuocation of his name.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.25.</note> For thus we read, <hi>And <hi>Adam</hi> knew his wife and ſhe brought forth a ſon, and called his name <hi>Seth,</hi> becauſe God</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>hath giuen me another ſonne for <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew him.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or an ornament, or a comfort: &amp; therefore <hi>Eue</hi> giues her ſonne this name. And this <hi>Seth</hi> may verie fitly reſemble <hi>faith,</hi>

                     </hi> begets <hi>Enoch,</hi> which in Hebrew ſignifies calamities, or miſeries: And this doth faith beget in man. True faith makes him confeſſe his frailtie, his miſerie, how that there remaines no goodnes in him.

In <hi>Seth</hi> his daies (as ſhould ſéeme) was no publique inuocation of the name of God. True religion would not ſo ſoone take roote,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:25632:233"/> though he laboured no doubt verie earneſtly about it; or elſe being planted of <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Cains</hi> poſteritie it had bene defaced.

No doubt they offered ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices then, as <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> did, and they did meditate <hi>of that promiſe of God made vnto them of the womans ſeed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> But this was a ſpeciall note of Gods Church: They called on the name of the Lord.

Secondly, <hi>we ſhall hereby glorifie God.</hi> This is ſuch a ſeruice and dutie, as belongeth to him alone; we may not yéeld it to anie other.

                     <hi>And <hi>Abraham</hi> came out of Aegypt, and his wife with him, and all that he had, and <hi>Lot</hi> with him, towards the South. And <hi>Abraham</hi> was verie rich in cattell and in ſiluer, and gold. And he went on his iourney from the South to Bethel, to the place where his tent had beene in the beginning, betweene Bethel and Haie, vnto the place of the Altar, which he had made there at the firſt. And there <hi>Abraham</hi> called on the name of the Lord.</hi> Here is <hi>Abrahams</hi> religion and worſhip of God ſet down in one word,<note place="margin">Rom. 4 12.</note> 
                     <hi>he called on the name of the Lord.</hi> As he is the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull in beleeuing</hi> (as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth) ſo he is their father in this point alſo. All his ſonnes muſt follow his
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:25632:233"/> ſteppes. This is a marke of the true Church. If they do this they cannot erre. And here we maie alſo note, that <hi>Abraham</hi> changed not his religion, though he had béen in Egypt: Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers muſt not alter their religion: they muſt not be like we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercocks, <hi>turned about with euerie blaſt of vaine doctrine.</hi>

Religion muſt be alwaies one, no time maie alter it, no wealth make it wauer. <hi>Abraham</hi> being now wealthie comes a great iourney to worſhip, euen there where he did worſhip before, when he was poore. So muſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rich men of this world do: riches muſt not choake their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their zeale in Gods ſeruice; as manie times they do.

The Philoſopher could ſay, <hi>he that found out benefites, found out fetters:</hi> And ſhall not Gods benefites binde them; as they did here <hi>Abraham,</hi> more firmelie vnto him?</p>
                  <p>Again, here Ieſus Chriſt is portraied out vnto vs: <hi>He comes to the altar betweene Bethel and Hai. Bethel</hi> in Hebrew ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Gods houſe; and <hi>Hai, deſolation,</hi> or a <hi>diſordered heape and maſſe:</hi> and maie fitlie repreſent the world.

                     <note place="margin">Eſay. 55.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and freely quench their thirſt. And <hi>Abraham</hi> there called on the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame leſſon no doubt he taught <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne, <hi>who went out at the euentide: <hi>Laſhnak,</hi>

                     <hi>For Gods word is the word of truth.</hi> And the markes of the Church that are in it ſet downe, are onely the true markes.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, although many other cleare and manifeſt marks of the Church might be gathered out of the ſcriptures, yet theſe markes are eſpecially to be marked of vs, which ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> puts downe in the Reuelation: For they concerne our daies, &amp; they are thoſe marks of Gods houſe, which Babylon had defaced, &amp; Antichriſt had raced out, ſo as in mans iudgement, it ſéemed impoſſible that euer they ſhould haue béene brought to light againe. Antichriſt heere dealt ſo cunningly, <hi>euen as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> did in murthering the Iſraelites children,</hi> intending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye their poſteritie;<note place="margin">Exod. 1.14</note>

                     <hi>hauing an euerlaſting goſpell to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to euerie nation, &amp; kinred, and tongue, and people.</hi> Here is the firſt marke of the Church, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpell: This marke Antichriſt had quite aboliſhed. And although in his kingdome, that he might not ſéeme to be quite oppoſite to Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; vtterly to diſallow preaching,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:25632:242"/> he had his Friers that preached: yet the paſtors of congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.42. 1 Pet. 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>whom Ieſus Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi> alſo commaunded to feede their flocke themſelues,</hi> in thoſe daies ſeldome preached. And theſe Friers preached not the Goſpell, but their legends of Saints commonly. And therefore the ſecond marke of the true Church, <hi>is to preach, not legends or olde wiues tales, but an euerlaſting Goſpell,</hi> that which was from the beginning; not a new faith deuiſed of mans braine in the ſucceſſion of manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for euer.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.

That goſpell which the Church of Rome now teacheth, is not ſuch a goſpell.</p>
                  <p>And this goſpell muſt be preached to the inhabitants of the earth, <hi>to euerie nation, and kinred, and tongue and people.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt had ſeduced all theſe:<note place="margin">Reu. 17.2.</note> all theſe <hi>were drunken with the pleaſant wine of Babylons fornication.</hi> Antichriſt had not ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the nation of the Iewes, as the Papiſts thinke hee ſhall. What néede the Diuell go about that? they are his alreadie, they are alreadie ſeduced as much as can be: but he ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all <hi>nations, tongues, kinreds and people:</hi> he ſhall peruert the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. And therfore to them it behooueth, that this euerlaſting goſpell ſhould be preached againe. The plaſter muſt be applied to the ſore.</p>
                  <p>And here that marke, which the Church of Rome woulde make men beléeue is a true marke of the true church, is quite ouerthrowne, and approoued to be a falſe marke.

                  <p>So that whereas God by his eternall word commandeth to <hi>feare him;</hi> and to be afraid to break his commandements, and <hi>to giue all glorie to him:</hi> the goſpell of Antichriſt was to feare man, and to kéepe his commandements, and to giue glorie to creatures.

And as for God, the moſt part of his commandements they knew not: and thoſe which they knew, were ſo corrupted by them, that they had as good almoſt not to haue knowne them at all.

So that by his meanes all nations do yéeld a kind of obedience to him, who no doubt, but for him, would haue forſaken him. Hath not he taught <hi>that men muſt make an image to the beaſt?</hi> That as there is one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the world: ſo there muſt be alſo in the Church. <hi>Hath not the former beaſt ſuffered him to do wonders in his ſight,</hi> euen what him pleaſed?

                     <note place="margin">Reu. 8.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and in the daies of the ſeuenth Angell, when he ſhall begin to blowe, the myſterie ſhall be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, there ſhall be no more time:</hi> the walles of Iericho ſhall fall downe. And ſurely the daie we liue in now, is the ſeuenth daie. At this daie, Iericho is compaſſed about with the Arke of God, euen ſeuen times, as much as in all the daies before. The plentifull preaching of the Goſpell; by men ſpeaking and writing more then euer before in anie age, plainly prooue this. The ſunne now ariſing, all the birds of heauen begin to ſing: whereas before the cockes onely did ſing. Surely this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of God in the world, and the profeſſion of his goſpell, euen of ſome wicked Kites, and couetous cormorants and Rauens, declares that the riſing of the true ſunne Ieſus Chriſt is not farre off. And as Iericho reſembles the worlde; ſo no doubt the houſe of <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot reſembles the Church. God will haue a houſe in Iericho,<note place="margin">Pſal. 87.4. Mat. 8.24.</note> he will <hi>haue a ſhippe on the raging ſea of this world.</hi> And firſt her name <hi>Rahab;</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>ſtreete</hi> or <hi>enlarged,</hi> agrées with the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.

                  <p>Antiquitie, which they make the ſecond mark of the Church, were of ſome force, if it be ſincere and pure.

                     <hi>The Churches had reſt through all Iurie &amp; Galile and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and were edified, and walked in the feare of the Lord, &amp; were multiplied by the comfort of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>He often repeates and beates into our heads, with what goods and riches the Primitiue Church was famous to our ſhame, which ſeek nothing but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: And wee thinke wee haue verie well prouided for the Church, if it abound in riches and riot.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after vpon theſe words, <hi>They entred into the Synagogue. <hi>The examples of Chriſtian life may be gathered out of this Text.</hi>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">In cap. 12. Act.</note> 
                     <hi>Firſt, they enter into the Synagogue, they teach not in corners. For he that doth the truth comes vnto the light. Secondly, thou ſeeſt heere that the Iewes on their Sabboths came together to heare the law: and for that cauſe eſpecially the Sabboth was ordained; And therefore hee ſaith not, on the Sabboth thou ſhalt be idle, but that thou ſhalt keep it holy. For the day is holy in it ſelfe, but it ought alſo to be holy vnto vs: which then it is, when wee ceaſe from doing euill works, &amp; giue our ſelues to thoſe which be good; and eſpecially to the hearing and meditation of the law of God, without which it is not kept holy at all. Neither is it ſufficient for thee to haue heard once, vnleſſe thou heare often. For the diuell is euer in aſſaulting thee, &amp; thou muſt euer reſiſt him with the word of God; by which alone he is ouercome. And alſo thou muſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the word of God, or elſe thou heareſt in vaine. Thou muſt meditate alſo of thine owne ſinnes, and of Gods bleſſings: theſe things alſo wee muſt doe in keeping and ſanctifying our Sabboth. Thirdly, he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     </hi> they ſate downe. <hi>Behold alſo</hi> Paul <hi>himſelfe ſits downe amongſt others, and heares the law: he doth not intrude himſelfe raſhly or fooliſhly, but with ſilence hee waites till op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie was offered to him of preaching. The which thing makes verie much againſt the deſpiſers of the Scriptures; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:25632:264"/> of vocall preachings. Fourthly,</hi> after, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> the reading of the law and the prophets. <hi>Thou ſeeſt here that the word of God, &amp; not mans fancies was read. Thou ſeeſt alſo, that they did not only teach the law; that is, works: but the Prophets alſo, that is, faith: for both theſe are verie profitable and neceſſary to ſaluation. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they ſent vnto them Paul <hi>did not ſpeake but being commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, leaſt he ſhould ſeem to any to be preſumptuous; againſt thoſe which cannot hold their peace, as</hi> Elihu <hi>in the booke of</hi> Iob. <hi>Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he ſaid, Men and brethren. <hi>Thou ſeeſt that after the reading of the law and Prophets, that by and by ought to follow exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and interpretation thereof: So</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith; There is but ſmall profit, if they ſpeake with tongues in the congregation, and doe not alſo propheſie and expound. Here alſo marke that propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not to be deſpiſed, &amp; that the interpretations &amp; iudgements of others in expounding the Scriptures are to be heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Héere we maie ſée as in a little mappe, the whole ſumme of Chriſtian religion; and the markes of the true Church. The true Church ſolemnizeth the Lords Sabboth in preaching and hearing his word. And without this, ſaith <hi>Ferus,</hi> there is no ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the Sabboth at all. And if this be true in the thicke darkneſſe of Poperie, where Gods word was neither preached nor heard, nor meditated on, there was no Sabboth kept: Nay euen in our daies, there are manie Catholikes, which thinke they keepe holy the Sabboth verie religiouſlie, and yet will not come to the Church to heare Gods word: And all ſuch <hi>Ferus</hi> tels, that they prophane the Sabboth, and kéepe no ſabboth at all. Againe, he teacheth that the onlie weapon to ouercome the diuell, is the word of God. Then no doubt the diuell was a great conqueror, when as no man almoſt had this ſword in his hand; he had made as great a conqueſt of Chriſtians ſoules, as <hi>Siſera</hi> had made of the bodies of the Iewes: of whom being now by her conquered, <hi>Deborah</hi> ſings thus: <hi>They choſe new gods: then warre was in the gates.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iud. 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Was there a ſpeare or ſhield found among fortie thouſand of Iſrael?</hi> So dealt <hi>Siſera</hi> with Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; and ſo dealt Sathan with Chriſtians; he depriued them of their weapons, to kéepe them more ſurely in his obedience. Can he be a mans friend, that takes his weapon from him in the midſt of moſt raging and cruell enemies? But this hath the Church of Rome done: ſhe hath taken the Scriptures,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:25632:265"/> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calles <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.16. 1. Pet. 5.8.</note> from the hands of the lay people: and the diuell is called of <hi>Peter <hi>A roaring ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeking whom he may deuoure.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the true Church</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ferus) <hi>Gods word is read, and not any fancies of man. Paul</hi>
                     </hi> himſelfe ſits and heares the word of God, and therefore no Chriſtian people muſt thinke ſcorne to do it. And that after the reading, preaching ought to follow; and that not only works, but faith alſo, muſt be taught. Theſe are the markes of the true Church, by <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement. And whether the Church of Rome haue had theſe in her or not, let euerie man iudge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In cap. 15. Act.</note>Againe, of Chriſtian religion he writes thus, vpon theſe words, <hi>Why go you about to lay a yoke? <hi>The ſecond reaſon is; that it is not lawfull for the Apoſtles to put a yoke vpon the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, which the Lord hath not put: for he that doth ſo, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God. It is the dutie of the Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel, that is, glad tidings, and not like tyrants to rule ouer mens conſciences. Let thoſe Biſhops marke theſe words of</hi> Peter, <hi>which make our religion, which the mercie of God would haue free in the fewneſſe and manifeſtneſſe of her ſeruices, a bondſlaue with their burthens they lay vpon it: ſo that the Iewes are in far better caſe then we, who were ſubiect to the ceremonies of the law, and not to mans deuiſes. And</hi> Auguſtine <hi>writes thus to the queſtions of</hi> Iamarus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> Euery true Catholike maie marke here how he toucheth the pope, who taketh vpon him to rule ouer mens conſciences, and euen to loade them with his decrees and conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Papiſts brag much of their generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: let vs mark how <hi>Ferus</hi> there deſcribes a true generall Councell vpon theſe words, <hi>And when there had beene great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion. <hi>See how wiſely they deale in the matter. They doe not raſhly pronounce ſentence: but they weigh euerie thing. For in matters of faith which touch the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it is not enough to ſay, We will and command. Marke therefore how the Apoſtles aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues together. They came together plainely, they ſeek for nothing elſe but the glorie of God; they deſire the ſaluation of others: To conclude, they weigh all things wiſely. What maruel is it then, if the holy Ghoſt were in this Councell, according to the promiſe of the Lord,</hi> Where two or three are gathered together, &amp;c. <hi>We come together otherwiſe, with great pompe and ſtate: we ſeek
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:25632:265"/> to maintaine our owne glorie and eſtate: and we perſwade our ſelues that we may do any thing by the fulneſſe of our authoritie: And how can the holy ghoſt allow ſuch aſſemblies &amp;c?</hi>
                     </hi> He touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Popes ſtate &amp; pride. He thinks that the holie Ghoſt will not guide ſuch proud and ſtately aſſemblies. Againe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and doctrine of that Councell he writes thus, vpon theſe words: <hi>Which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare. <hi>The law is an intollerable burthen; becauſe it requires not onely our hand, but alſo our heart. Secondly, becauſe it conuinceth vs to be ſinners: For wee doe euer more againſt the lawe, then according to the law. And alſo thoſe things we do according to the law, wee do them imperfectly: but by the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt we do beleeue to be ſaued. A concluſion and a knitting vp of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both very godly and Apoſtolike, that by the grace of Chriſt both Iewes and Gentiles are ſaued, and not of their merits. For only Chriſt ſufficeth to all: ſo that the law profiteth nothing to the Iewes to their ſaluation: for euen they are ſaued by grace, &amp; not by the law: ſo farre againſt all reaſon is it, that any man ſhould impoſe thoſe things to the Gentiles, which profited not the Iewes themſelues. And to this end were the Epiſtles of Saint</hi> Paul <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Romans, and to the Galathians: And our ſaluation is called the grace of Chriſt, becauſe he hath deſerued it for vs. Let them therefore bragge of their merits: we will ſeeke the glory of God.</hi>
                     </hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> Here is the true Church put downe, and her doctrine, the milke ſhe giues her children: That onely the grace of Ieſus Chriſt ſaues, &amp; not merits. She that brags of her merits, and truſts in them is the ſtrumpet, is the whore, is not the true Church, and the ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, by <hi>Ferus</hi> his iudgement.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is obiected of ſome againſt the Goſpell, that ſince the preaching thereof hereſies haue ſprung vp in the world, and that before the Church was in peace: let vs marke how <hi>Ferus</hi> anſwereth that obiection vpon theſe words,<note place="margin">Ferus in cap. 13. Act.</note> 
                     <hi>And he reſiſted them. <hi>Behold the combat</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of truth and falſhood. This combate euer hath beene and will be: God ſpake but one word in Paradiſe, and by and by came the ſerpent, which reſiſted it: <hi>Moſes</hi> being ſent into Egypt, found there ſorcerers which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him. The Prophets euer had falſe Prophets oppoſite vnto them. Chriſt comming into the world, found aduerſaries. The
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:25632:266"/> ſame thing chanced to his Apoſtles. Let vs not therefore be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, if there be now great diſſenſion and quarels about religion. Neither for this cauſe muſt we neglect to go to godly ſermons: but rather let vs diligently do this. Firſt call vpon God with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, ſaying; <hi>Shew me thy wayes, O Lord, and teach me thy paths.</hi> Then compare the doctrines diligently together: and that which thou ſhalt perceiue more forcible to drawe thee from the world to God, from the fleſh to the Spirit, from euill to goodneſſe, and from idolatrie to the true worſhipping of God, embrace that without anie feare, with tooth and naile (as they ſay) nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the gaineſayings of others. The diuell hath euer gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, That good deeds and words might bee made none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, leaſt men beleeuing ſhould bee ſaued. Therefore by his miniſters he ſowes errours; and ſometimes alſo hee doth worke miracles, that by errours he might make Gods word, and by falſe ſignes, Gods works to be lightly ſet by; that by this means he may rather draw men quite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word; or at leaſt wiſe, he may make them diſtruſt and doubt of it. God ſuffers this firſt, that the godly may be tried according to that, <hi>If a Prophet riſe among you, &amp;c. beleeue him not,</hi>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 13.1.</note> 
                     <hi>for God tries you. <hi>And hereof alſo Chriſt ſaith, that</hi> in the end of the world ſo great ſhall be the beguilings of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that if it vvere poſſible, the very elect ſhould be ſeduced. <hi>And hereof Saint</hi> Iohn <hi>ſaith:</hi> Beleeue not euerie ſpirit, but proue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whether they be of God or no. <hi>The doctrin of the Goſpell which we haue receiued, is the word of God which hath been confirmed by many ſignes: and with the bloud of many thouſands: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man doubt of that, although an Angell from heauen ſhould perſwade the contrarie. Againe, therefore God ſuffers the diuell to ſhew lying ſignes, that the wicked may be more blinded: For it is done by the iuſt iudgement of God, that they which will not beleeue the truth, ſhould be ſeduced, and ſhould cleaue to lies.</hi>
                     </hi> Thus far <hi>Ferus.</hi> Where he plainly teacheth, that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that after the preaching of the Goſpell contention and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies haue ſprung in the Church: he ſaith, it hath béene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo, and ſhall be euer. And that for this cauſe no man ought to refuſe to go and heare ſermons. And he loues the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell, &amp; not anie lying miracles, as the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of true Chriſtian religion.</p>
                  <p>And after, concerning the ſame matter, he writes thus vpon
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:25632:266"/> theſe words, <hi>The citie was deuided.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ferus in 14. cap. Act.</note> 
                     <hi>Here thou ſeeſt fulfilled that which Chriſt foretold, <hi>I came not to ſend peace into the world, but a ſword.</hi> The Goſpell teacheth not ſeditions, nor ſoweth diſcords; but becauſe it reprooueth their ſinnes, it cannot chooſe but the worldlings ſhould repine againſt it. I came to ſend fire vpon the earth; maruell not therefore if there ſpring vp and be ſects in the world; for it hath beene euer ſo: yea there muſt be hereſies, that the elect may be proued. As much more as we ſee ſects to ariſe, ſo let vs ſtriue earneſtly to find and ſearch out the truth, and to ſtand firmely and vnmoueably in the confeſſed truth, and to profeſſe it boldly vnto our liues end.</hi> And after he writes thus of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground of euerie true Chriſtians faith.<note place="margin">Ferus in cap. Act. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Euerie Chriſtian ought to bee ſo ſure of his faith, that if all the world were of a contrarie opinion, yet he could ſay: I am ſure this is Gods word; let other men think what they will, God cannot deceiue or beguile. Yea if an Angell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen ſhould preach the contrarie, let him be accurſed. Vnles thou be thus grounded, thou canſt not ſtand ſtedfaſtly, when the falſe Apoſtles ſhall teach the contrarie. And hereof Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce: and they will not heare ſtangers, but run from them.</hi>
                     </hi> Gods word by <hi>Ferus</hi> iudgement is the onely Rocke of Chriſtians faith and religion in theſe doubtful daies. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in another place he makes theſe ſteps of Chriſtianitie: <hi>Marke in the foreſaid words this order in Chriſtianitie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ferus in cap. 22. Act.</note> 
                     <hi>Firſt is the predeſtination of God. <hi>For it is not of him that willeth, but of God that ſheweth mercie.</hi> Reade the ninth chapter to the Romans. And we are predeſtinate not to idleneſſe or wantonneſſe: but that wee may know the will of God, what kind of one he is towards vs, &amp; what he requires and willes at our hands. Then wee are ſent to Chriſt, in whom alone we ſee how God is affected to vs. By him alſo we receiue the holy Ghoſt, that we may be able to doe the will of God. After we haue knowne Chriſt, it remaines that in our life, maners, and words we teſtifie his goodneſſe towards vs, and that we are his diſciples. And this teſtimonie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts in foure things: Firſt, that we riſe vp from our old conuerſation. Secondly, that we be baptized, and bee partakers of the Sacraments. Thirdly, that we waſh away the ſinnes whereinto wee haue fallen, by Chriſts bloud. Fourthly, that we call vpon his name, that is, his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and merits.</hi> Here <hi>Ferus</hi> doth as it were make a perfect ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of a Chriſtian man.

                  <p>And in another place, of Chriſtian conuerſation he writes thus:<note place="margin">Ferus in cap.

For we euer ſtand neede of the helpe of God: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him we can do nothing: We are not ſufficient of ourſelues to thinke any thing that is good.</hi> And againe, <hi>He workes in vs both the will, and to finiſh. <hi>And in</hi> Oſee, O Iſrael, thy deſtruction comes of thy ſelfe, but thy helpe comes of me. <hi>Let no man therefore truſt in his owne ſtrength</hi> Curſed is he that puts fleſh his arme. <hi>Therefore</hi> Paul <hi>neuer tooke any thing in hand, nor finiſhed anie thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of prayer. Secondly, he kneeles downe; againſt thoſe which make a ieſt at all ceremonies in prayers. He that goes about to make his prayers vnto God, muſt haue well profited firſt in the ſchoole of humility, otherwiſe he ſhall not be heard. The prayers of him that humbleth himſelfe pierceth the clouds. And hereof it is ſaid by the Prophet;</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom ſhall my Spirit reſt; but vpon the humble and peaceble. <hi>And thirdly, he prayes not alone, but with all the companie. The prayers of the holy Church is of great force. So when the Apoſtles continued praying with one accord and conſent, the holy Ghoſt came vpon them, and filled them all. In like maner after the Iewes had threatned them; when they had prayed altogether the place moued, and they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt. And this is that which Chriſt promiſed once;</hi> If two of you ſhall agree vpon earth, whatſoeuer thing they ſhall aske, it ſhall be done vnto them <hi>Ferus</hi>
                     </hi> would haue common praiers made with the common conſent of the whole Church; or elſe (ſaith he) they are of no force. Contrarie to the common practiſe of the Roman Church amongſt vs in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe he writes thus of the euill life of the Church, which offends manie:<note place="margin">Ferus in cap. Act. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Although it be a great imperfection and defect, where the life is not approued and vertuous: yet there is leſſe danger, if the faith be right and ſound, then if the life were good, and the faith euill. For <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> and he that comes to God muſt beleeue. Therefore it is of more force if the faith be pure and good, then if thy works were good.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ferus.</hi> He preferres that Church which hath a right
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:25632:267"/> faith, although in ſome reſpect ſhe faile in good workes; before that Church which hath good works and an euill faith.</p>
                  <p>And of the Church,<note place="margin">Ferus in Act 21.</note> and of the ſacrifices thereof he writes thus: <hi>Paul <hi>taught that Gods houſe was the Church, and that now the true ſacrifice was to bee offered in euerie place;</hi>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">So Theodoret expounds it in cap 1. Malach. &amp; alleageth this place of S Paul and that of our Sauiour Ioh 4.23. 1. Tim. 2.8.</note>

                  <p>And of religion maintained by warres, he writes thus: <hi>He that maintaines his cauſe by ſeditions and tumults of the people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ferus in Act. 21.</note>

But let our mind paſſe beyond theſe, and let it paſſe ouer all that is created; and let it runne and climbe vp and flie and paſſe ouer; and with all her force, let her direct the eyes of her faith vpon him, which hath created all things. Therefore I will make as it were a ladder in my heart, and by the ſtaues thereof I will climbe vp to my ſoule, and by my ſoule and my mind, I will climbe vp to my God, which is aboue ouer my head. Whatſoeuer is viſibly ſeen, whatſoeuer is ſpiritually ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, with force let it be far remoued from the ſight of my ſoule and heart, my vnderſtanding alone &amp; by it ſelfe going forward, let it fly ſwiftly to him, who is the creator of Angels and ſouls, and of all things.

                     <hi>not only in Macedonia and Achaia: but your faith towards God came into euerie place. So that we neede ſay nothing thereof, for they ſhew and declare what an entrance we had vnto you, &amp; how you turned vnto the Lord from idols, to ſerue the liuing and true God, and to looke for his ſonne from heauen, whom he raiſed from the dead, euen Ieſus, who deliuereth vs from the anger to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are moſt manifeſtly ſet downe the markes of the true Church, and the Catholike faith which was in Saint <hi>Paules</hi> dayes preached through the whole world: <hi>To turne from Idols, and to ſerue the true and liuing God.</hi> And here firſt that blind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Latria</hi> (which the Papiſts make to cloak the worſhipping of creatures) is quite ouerthrowne, not onely <hi>Latria,</hi> but, as by this place appeareth, <hi>Dulia</hi> is due vnto God. Secondly, we muſt <hi>ſerue the true and liuing God.</hi> Theſe two Adiuncts take away all worſhipping of falſe gods, and alſo of Images. We muſt worſhip no falſe nor dead thing: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we worſhip, it muſt be liuing and true. And therefore we muſt worſhip no Images, which are dead ſtockes, nay wee muſt worſhip nothing but God alone. Thoſe Images which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> deſcribeth, <hi>Pſal. 115.</hi> what are they els but Papiſts Images? That <hi>Pſalme</hi> followeth the <hi>114. Pſal.</hi> which
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:25632:273"/> containeth Iſraels going out of Egypt, &amp; it may ſéeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſpirituall Egypt. Thirdly, we muſt now <hi>euery day waite and looke for the comming of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt from heauen.</hi> We muſt not thinke that he will not come yet, as the Papiſts teach by their doctrine of Antichriſt. Fourthly, wee muſt conſtantly beléeue, <hi>that Ieſus hath not onely deliuered vs by his paſſion from the guilt of ſinne: but from the puniſhment alſo thereof, and anger to come.</hi> And laſtly, if the Papiſts will thereof conclude, that the Church of Rome is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church of all the worlde,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> becauſe Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith that <hi>their faith was publiſhed throughout all the world.</hi> Then the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> muſt be her elder ſiſter,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Neither do we finde fault with the one, that wee might commend the other; but all are commended, that thoſe that are more excellent may be preferred. Mariage therefore is honorable,
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:25632:281"/> but virginitie is more honorable. For he that ioynes his virgin in mariage doth well, and he that couples her not in mariage doth better. Therefore that which is good, is not to be eſchewed.</hi> And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth alſo thus: <hi>It is good to marie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de bono coniug. cap. 9. &amp; 10.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe it is good to beget children, and to be a houſekeeper: but it is better not to marie; becauſe it is better for humane ſocietie not to ſtand in neede of this worke. But I know ſome that murmure: What (ſay they) if all men ſhould abſtaine from mariage, how then ſhould mankind be maintained? I would to God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine) all men would do this, onely in charitie, and from a pure heart, and from a good conſcience, and not from a fained faith: for then a great deale ſooner Gods citie ſhould be filled, and the end of the world ſhould be haſtened. For what other thing ſeems the Apoſtle to meane, when as he ſaith, ſpeaking thereof: I would to God that all men were as I am, or in that place? This I ſay bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe the time is ſhort; it remaineth that they alſo which haue wiues, be as though they had none: and they that weepe, as though they wept not; and they that reioyce, as though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced not; &amp; they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; &amp; they that vſe this world, as though they vſed it not; for the faſhion of this world goeth away.

Surely the Papiſts Mattens, if they had béene done with vnderſtanding, had béene more agréeable to Gods word, then our ſlouthfull and ſluggiſh prayers are which wee now vſe. God will be ſerued earlie in the morning: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is noted as a ſpeciall mark and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith, that when as he was commanded to offer his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 22.3.</note> that <hi>Abraham roſe vp in the morning very early.</hi> If <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> roſe vp ſo early to offer ſuch a ſorrowfull ſacrifice; what ſhould we doe, which offer vp ſuch a pleaſant ſacrifice to God, as our prayers are? Hence it is that the Chriſtians in the Primitiue Church (as hereafter ſhall be noted) had their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies before day to praie to God, and to giue him thanks.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures alſo teach Chriſtians to ioine another cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to their prayers, and that is wéeping and ſighing. And ſo no doubt <hi>Samuel</hi> prayed for <hi>Saul,</hi> as before it hath béene alleaged. And <hi>Dauid</hi> often mentioneth theſe his teares added
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:25632:287"/> to his prayers: <hi>Euery night will I waſh my bed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and water my couch with my teares.</hi> And againe, <hi>Away</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from me ye wicked, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.</hi>

                     <hi>Dauids</hi> teares ſpake to God. And againe, <hi>Heare my prayer, O Lord, and hearken vnto my crie; keep not ſtill ſilence at my teares.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.12.</note> And thus it is alſo recorded of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> that when as <hi>Eſay</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had denounced to him that heauie meſſage from the Lord: <hi>Put thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not liue:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. King 20.3</note> that then <hi>he turned his face to the wal, and prayed to the Lord, ſaying, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Dauid thy father: I haue heard thy prayers, and ſeene thy teares: Behold I haue now healed thee.</hi> No doubt, if Chriſtians in their ſickneſſe would vſe theſe pilles, to purge their heads withall, that is, their teares (as <hi>Ezechias</hi> did) God would heale them, as he did him. Theſe teares are the beſt and ſureſt purgations in the world. And for lacke of theſe, it is likely all our other pilles and potions deuiſed of Phyſitions, do manie times ſo little good.

                     <hi>Turne to the Lord with weeping, faſting and mourning.</hi> So theſe Iſraelits here no doubt, turned to God.

                     <hi>we ſhould not be iudged of the Lord.</hi> But now for lacke of this iudgement <hi>many are ſicke amongſt you, and many ſleepe and are dead.</hi>

<pb n="548" facs="tcp:25632:288" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, ſhould now be as it were a iudge againſt himſelfe, &amp; euen as it were puniſh himſelfe by faſting, weeping, &amp; praying for his ſins, and ſo turne to God, as <hi>Ioel</hi> counſelleth. And then as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here teacheth, without doubt he ſhall eſcape the iudgements and plagues of God in this world, as ſickneſſe and ſuch other euils, which his ſinnes deſerue. But aboue all other examples, eſpeciallie the example of our Sauiour, ſhould moue vs to ioyne theſe teares to our prayers; of whom wee reade thus: <hi>Which in the dayes of his fleſh, did offer vp prayers and ſupplications,</hi>

Let vs follow his example. But what ſpeak I of ſhedding teares when we pray; ſome are now growne ſo ſtiffe-necked, that they will hardlie how their knées when they praie. That is now accounted of manie ſuperſtition: they ſaie it is ſufficient to bow the knées of their hearts.

                  <p>To conclude then this ſecond dutie of a Chriſtian: Thus he is taught manifeſtlie in the word of God; to praie continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie, thriſe a daie at leaſt. To watch in the night in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: to praie earlie in the morning: and to ioyne with his prayers faſting, wéeping and knéeling. And then when he prayeth, the Lord ſhall heare him, as hee did <hi>Dauid; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his ſoule with much ſtrength.</hi>

                  <p>A third dutie which concernes all Chriſtians, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort

And this is that which <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith: <hi>And hee ſaide vnto them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 17.12</note> 
                     <hi>Beware of all vnrighteous things.

And this is that allegorie of a bodie, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo vſeth, and teacheth vs:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> 
                     <hi>We are all members of Chriſts bodie.</hi> Now euerie member will not onelie labour for, and helpe another; but alſo if it be hurt will haue a care to heale it againe: The ſame care ſhould euerie Chriſtian haue of his brother.

                     <hi>Take heed brethren leaſt at anie time there bee in anie of you an euill heart and vnbeleeuing, to depart from the liuing God. But exhort one another dayly while it is called to day, leaſt any of you bee hardened by the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</hi> No doubt, for lacke of this daily exhortation, ſo manie at this daie amongſt vs are hardened with ſin. No man now adaies exhorteth his brother to do good. A man maie do what he liſt: no man will reproue him. And the ſame leſſon he repeates againe, as a leſſon worthie the learning:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Let vs conſider one another to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vnto loue and good workes, not forſaking the fellowſhip that we haue amongſt our ſelues, as the maner of ſome is: but let vs exhort one another, and that ſo much the more, becauſe yee ſee that the day draweth neere, &amp;c.</hi> The néerer that the day of iudgement approcheth, the more we ſtand in néed of this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and prouocation one of another forward to good works.

                     <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> What haue I to doe with my brother? This is a <hi>Caines,</hi> and not a Chriſtians voice. The <hi>holy Ghoſt fell vpon the Apoſtles in the forme of fitie tongues:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2.3.</note> To teach all Chriſtians (that are indued with the holie Ghoſt) what their duties are: they muſt be tongues, they muſt not be dumbe: they muſt exhort; they muſt teach, they muſt ſpeake: yea they muſt be firie tongues; that is, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue alſo. But now adaies that ſaying of King <hi>Dauid</hi> is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Who will riſe vp with me againſt the wicked? Or who will take my part againſt the euil doers?</hi> Perchance one (amongſt an hundred) endued with this firie zeale of Gods Spirit, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke ſinne, will ſtand vp againſt the wicked: but no man will take his part, no man will ioine with him. And ſo by that meanes, his godly zeale doth little good. One man is no man, as the prouerbe is. And without manie be ioined and coupled together, there is no ſtrength, there is no force.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, as euery man is bound to exhort his brother: ſo eſpeciallie euerie Maſter his familie, as appeareth by Gods owne ſpéech to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when as hee reuealed to him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sodome.<note place="margin">Ge. 18.17. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>And the Lord ſaid: Shall I hide from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham that thing which I do? Seeing that Abraham ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great and a mightie nation, and all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him. For I know him that he will command his ſonnes, and his houſhold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, to doe righteouſneſſe and iudgement, that the Lord may bring vpon Abraham that hee hath ſpoken vnto him.</hi> Let vs mark here, all that will be accounted <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, what God himſelfe pronounceth of <hi>Abraham:</hi> that hee will teach his ſonnes and his familie to feare God, do righteouſneſſe; and let vs follow his ſteps: then ſhall all that God hath promiſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> come vnto vs. Would we then be partakers of Gods promiſes and of his bleſſings? let vs then inſtruct our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and families. Here is a condition or limitation preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to vs by Gods own mouth. All men condemne <hi>Herod that killed the Innocents:</hi> and yet they which catechize not their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and children are more cruell then he:<note place="margin">Matth. 2.16.</note> for he killed other mens children, and theſe men kill their owne. Nay, hee killed but their bodies only; and theſe kill their ſoules. O cruell <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods!</hi>
                     <pb n="551" facs="tcp:25632:289"/> Let all true Chriſtians beware of this crueltie; and be rather <hi>Abrahams</hi> true children in inſtructing their children and families, that ſo all Gods promiſes and bleſſings maie come vpon them.</p>
                  <p>The Tyger is reported <hi>of all wild beaſts to be moſt ſwift,</hi>

                     <hi>ſo that they which take her whelpes from her, haue ſhips readie; and ſo taking ſhip, ſhe cannot purſue them, nor ouertake them; which otherwiſe could not eſcape from her. But when ſhe perceiues that one of her whelpes is ſtolne from her, and that ſhe cannot recouer it againe; it is written of her, that vpon the ſea ſhore, for verie griefe ſhe will throw her ſelfe downe headlong into the ſea; puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing her owne ſlowneſſe with ſuch a voluntarie deſtruction.</hi> O the louing nature of this wild beaſt to her whelpes! And ſhall not Chriſtians ſhew the like loue to their children? If they bee wicked, and giuen to anie ſinne; not théeues (as thoſe Tygers whelps) but the diuell hath ſtolne awaie and poſſeſſed them: and ſhal not this grieue them? eſpeciallie when they ſee it with their eies. Let all Chriſtians be more kind to their children then Tygers: Let them teach them the feare of Lord, as <hi>Dauid</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: <hi>Come ye children, &amp; hearken vnto me,</hi>

So no doubt <hi>Abraham,</hi> although he had but one ſon of <hi>Sarah,</hi> yet he pampered him not (as ſhould ſéeme) but inſtructed him in the law of God.

                     <hi>but where is the lambe for the burnt offering?</hi> euen being ſo young, he knew what a ſacrifice meant: no doubt his father had taught him. So ought all Chriſtians after his example to inſtruct their children in the principles of Chriſtian religion.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo no doubt catechized and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his familie; hauing in his familie a greate number (as appeareth by that reſcue of <hi>Lot) <hi>Who brought forth 318. that were borne and brought vp in his houſe,</hi>

                     <hi>and with them purſued thoſe kings which had taken Lot priſoner.</hi> When as God after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to circumciſe himſelfe and all his familie that were males, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.23.</note> that <hi>Abraham <hi>circumciſed them all the

                     </hi> No doubt, they had béene well inſtructed before, both in their duties and obedience towards God, and alſo their maiſter: or els all of them ſo willinglie, and ſo readilie would not haue yéelded to ſuch a painefull thing, as circumciſion was. So <hi>Dauid</hi> being a king had care of his familie and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; to teach all Noblemen and Gentlemen the like care of their families. <hi>Socrates</hi> common by-word is often proued true: <hi>That moſt commonly in great mens houſes either ſome great good,</hi>

                     <hi>or ſome great euill is hatched.</hi> And firſt concerning the choiſe of his ſeruants,<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.6</note> 
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be vnto the faithfull of the land, that they may dwell with me, and hee that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerue me.</hi> And then for the kéeping and correcting his ſeruants he writes thus: <hi>There ſhall no deceitfull perſon dwell within my houſe. He that telleth lies ſhall not tarie in my ſight.</hi> No doubt, he did reproue both deceitfull and lying ſeruants,<note place="margin">2. King. 5.25.</note> and which were like to <hi>Gehezi;</hi> and alſo other ſins in his ſeruants. And if they would not be reformed, he would not keepe them anie longer. I would to God all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen would doe the like: then we ſhould haue a flouriſhing Church and common wealth: then ſo much ſinne would not be committed, as is commonly. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans or a Noblemans ſeruant will preſume to ſinne, becauſe of the authoritie of his maiſter, or becauſe his maiſter hee knowes neuer mindes what he doth: and ſometime will not ſticke to tell a lie, to féed his maiſters humour. Such preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lying, and flattering ſeruants king <hi>Dauid</hi> would not kéepe in his houſe. Such a care alſo no doubt of his familie had that good ruler, whoſe ſonne Chriſt healed. It is written of him, that after his <hi>ſonne was healed,</hi>

                     <hi>that he beleeued and all his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold.</hi> No doubt the good maiſter had a care to inſtruct all his familie in that faith and waie of ſaluation, which he beléeued himſelfe. So <hi>Cornelius</hi> alſo hath this commendation giuen him:<note place="margin">Act. 10.2.</note> 
                     <hi>There was a certaine man in Caeſarea called Cornelius a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the band called the Italian band, a deuout man, one that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God with all his houſhold, which gaue much almes to the people, &amp; prayed God continually.</hi> Here is a notable patterne ſet downe of a good houſholder, for all Chriſtians to follow. Hee feared God and all his houſhould; he gaue much almes to the people, and prayed God continually. He is not commended for the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:25632:290"/> building or furniture of his houſe: but for his deuotion; for his care of his familie; for his almeſdéedes; and for his daylie prayers. O that we had manie ſuch houſekéepers! theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhould make them more famous,<note place="margin">Ier. 22.14.15.</note> then building ſtatelie towers, and high walles, and large windowes. <hi>This is to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iudgement and to do righteouſneſſe,</hi> as <hi>Ieremie</hi> teacheth that <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> that proud king of <hi>Iuda;</hi> &amp; in him all other maner of men. So that good Emperour <hi>Conſtantine made his pallace as it were a Church, in catechiſing his family himſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Euſeb. de vita Conſt. lib. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and both commanding them to pray, and alſo teaching them how to pray,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his life recordeth. Nay he tolde the biſhops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at a certaine time with him: <hi>you will ſay, quoth he, that I am a Biſhop: and ſo I am indeed; but I within, and you abroad:</hi> And in his coine, to declare what account he made of prayer, he cauſed himſelf to <hi>be pictured with his eyes looking vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> as it were euer crauing or requeſting ſomething of God. And theſe were the common monie or coine that they vſed through all the Roman Empire, during his raigne. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>he was pictured at the entrance into his pallace, kneeling on his knees, as ſome ſuter; and his eyes lifted vp to heauen.</hi> This <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth of him. O noble and Chriſtian Emperour! that was thus zealous of Gods ſeruice, both himſelfe, and alſo which cauſed his family and ſubiects thus to ſerue God like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. How ſince his dayes Chriſtians are degenerated, all men maie ſée. Now they are accounted preciſe, that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and gouerne their families. But this in his dayes <hi>was not preciſeneſſe, but Chriſtianitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that all Chriſtians ought to inſtruct their families, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> writes thus verie excellentlie:<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ho. 78. in. Matt.</note> 
                     <hi>And ſurely if thou longeſt greatly to be with Chriſt; then do his will: and his will is eſpecially that thou ſhouldeſt ſtudie to profite thy neighbour. Wilt thou haue me proue this vnto thee out of another place? <hi>O Peter doeſt thou loue me?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>feed my ſheepe.</hi> And when as he had asked him this thriſe, he confirmed that this was an argument of his loue. Which thing was not ſpoken only to Prieſts; but alſo to euery one of vs, to whom a little flocke is committed: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a verie little flocke; therfore it muſt not be neglected: for my father hath a pleaſure in them. Euery one of vs hath a ſheep, let vs leade it to fat paſtures. When therefore a maiſter of a familie
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:25632:291"/> ſhall riſe from his bed, let him care for nothing elſe, then that he may do and ſpeake thoſe things, by which he may increaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in his whole family. The good wife alſo, let her haue a care of her houſe; but let her greateſt care be concerning thoſe things which belong to heauen; Let all the whole family do thoſe things. For if in our worldly affaires we preferre the matters of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, before our houſhold affaires; leſt for the payment of theſe common taxes and ſubſidies we being brought before the Iudge, and being puniſhed, we ſhould incurre blame &amp; reproch: how much more in ſpirituall matters ought wee to haue a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall care of them firſt of all, which concerne God our creator, and that great king of all kings; leaſt that we be drawne thither, where is gnaſhing of teeth? Let vs therfore embrace thoſe vertues, which are profitable to our own ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; alſo profitable to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> Wherefore as firſt he teacheth vs; that that commandement of our Sauiour Chriſt to <hi>Peter, <hi>Feede my ſheepe,</hi>
                     </hi> belongs not only to him or his ſucceſſours, as the Papiſts now teach, but to euerie Chriſtian. Euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is <hi>Peter;</hi> and muſt féed his little flock, his familie that is committed vnto him.<note place="margin">Origen in Matt. hom. 1. in cap. 6.</note> As alſo <hi>Origen</hi> expounded that ſaying of our Sauiour to <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>16.</hi> of <hi>Matth. To thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen: It ſeemes to bee ſpoken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to all perfect Chriſtians. For they are all Peters and Rockes, and in them all is the Church builded. And if you thinke that the Church was built of that one Peter; what doe you ſay of Iames and Iohn the ſonnes of thunder, and of the other Apoſtles?</hi> Wee maie note here the conſent of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding theſe two places, concerning the Popes primacie, otherwiſe then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts do now: And yet they wold make the world beléeue, that all the Fathers were on their ſide. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> teacheth, that euerie maiſter is bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his familie; yea more then to paie his ſubſidie to the Prince. For this is a ſubſidie that is due to the king of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which hee requires at all mens hands. And that euerie Chriſtian ought to know the Scriptures, and to be able to doe this,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ho. 2 in cap. 1. Matt.</note> he writes thus in another place: <hi>Which of you, I pray you, that ſtand here, can ſay one Pſalme without booke, if ye were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined; or anie other portion of ſcripture? Surely there is none. And this is not onely the miſchiefe, that you are ſlouthfull &amp; ſlacke
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:25632:291"/> to learne ſpirituall things, but to learne diueliſh things ye are more hot then fire: for if any one ſhould aske you anie vaine ballads, or any ſuch like fooliſh and vnchaſt ſongs and tunes, hee ſhall find verie manie that are skilfull in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that alſo will ſing them with great pleaſure and delight. But this is the common excuſe of theſe faults: I am no Monke (ſaith he) I haue wife and children and a familie to care for. This is that which as a common plague, marres all, becauſe you thinke that the reading of the Scriptures doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to Monks; when as it is farre more neceſſarie for you, then for them. For they which are conuerſant in the worlde, and receiue dayly wound vpon wound; doe not they ſtand more in need of the ſalues of God? &amp;c.</hi> Let vs note here how that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> would haue all men to reade the Scriptures; he excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none: they néede not ſéeke to the Ordinarie to be licenſed to reade them, as the Papiſts now teach. Naie, that this is more neceſſarie for them, then either for Prieſts or Monkes. And that this is Gods ſalue to heale their daily wounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and then they need not to feare anie harme therby as the Papiſts now do.</p>
                  <p>A fourth dutie, which belongs to all Chriſtians is, that they ought to deſpiſe the world, and all the vaine pompes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof. And this we haue all vowed in our Baptiſmes. but alas how ſmally is this vow amongſt many, either regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or almoſt euer all their whole life after remembred? And this ſolemne vow &amp; promiſe is grounded of the word of God: <hi>Loue not the world</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) nor the things that are in the world. If any man loue the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>the loue of the Father is not in him.</hi> And S <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith. <hi>He that is a friend to the world, is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed enemie to God.</hi> O dangerous frienſhip,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.4.</note> which bereaueth vs of the fauour of God! Nay, which oppoſeth vs as open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God. And yet no man almoſt feares or cares for it. And leaſt wee ſhould bee deceiued, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> puts downe plainly what the loue of this world meaneth: <hi>For al that is in the world</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</hi> As though he ſhould ſaie, thoſe things which our fleſh deſireth, which our eyes delight in, which our life gapes after ſo gréedily, are not of the father: but are the worlds dearlings. And all theſe muſt all Gods children contemne, hate, and deſpiſe. And who is it
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:25632:292"/> not now that yéelds to his fleſh all that it deſireth? Who is it that feedeth not his vaine eyes? Who is it that followeth not after the pride and ſtate of this preſent life? We follow at this day that rich man, of whom our Sauiour makes mention, <hi>We followe not Chriſt himſelfe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 16.19</note> 
                     <hi>That rich man was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared delicately euerie day. And there was a poore man named Lazarus, which lay at his gate full of ſores,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.6.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is in two words all theſe comprehended: The <hi>luſt of the fleſh,</hi> to fare daintily: the <hi>ſtate of this life,</hi> to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed gorgeouſly: and the <hi>luſt of the eyes,</hi> to bee couetous and vnmercifull, not ſo much as once to looke vpon poore <hi>Lazarus.</hi> But theſe delights and deſires (though we read not that he did anie man wrong to maintaine and fulfill them) damned him in hell. And here let all ſuch take héede by his example, that to maintaine theſe, do oppreſſe and deale hardlie with the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Ieſus Chriſt. Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>who is the way, the truth, and the life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 14, 6.</note> deſpiſed all theſe, and ſo muſt all his Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>So did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who writes thus of himſelfe: <hi>God forbid that I ſhould reioyce, but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; whereby the world is crucified to me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; I vnto the world.</hi> What worldly pompe or delight was there in the croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt? but hunger, cold, nakedneſſe, vineger, raylings, and ſuch like. In theſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> reioyced. Let the worldlings, with that rich man, delight in their braue apparell, in their daintie fare, in their ſtate and pompe: S. <hi>Paul</hi> with his Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will deſpiſe all theſe; and reioice rather in nakednes, in hunger, in reproches, as he himſelfe witneſſeth in another place: <hi>Euen vnto this houre we both hunger and thirſt, &amp; are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; are buffetted, &amp; haue no certaine dwelling place:</hi> no place to put our heads in. This is the croſſe of Chriſt, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reioyced in. Here is a contempt of all the pleaſures of the world. And in another place: <hi>We approue our ſelues the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God in much patience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>in afflictions, in neceſſities, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</hi> Here is the proofe, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, and by the ſame arguments muſt all Chriſtians proue themſelues to be Chriſtians. For thus our Sauiour pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth of his Apoſtles, and in them of all Chriſtians: <hi>Bleſſed are ye poore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 6.20.</note> 
                     <hi>for yours is the kingdome of God. Bleſſed are yee that hunger; for ye ſhall be ſatisfied. Bleſſed are ye that weepe
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:25632:292"/> now, for ye ſhall laugh. Bleſſed are ye when men hate you, and when they ſeparate you and reuile you; and put out your name as euill, for the Sonne of mans ſake. Reioyce you in that day and be glad: For behold your reward is great in heauen: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner did their fathers to the Prophets. But woe vnto you that are rich; for you haue receiued your conſolation. Wo be vnto you that are full; for ye ſhall hunger. Wo be to you that now laugh; for ye ſhall waile and weepe. Wo be to you when all men ſpeake well of you; for ſo did their fathers to the falſe prophets, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is plainly put downe <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus. Diues</hi> was rich, was full, reioyced euerie daie; was highly (no doubt) commended of all men: and <hi>Lazarus</hi> was poore, hungry, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; contemned of all men. But mark what followes &amp; befals to both theſe: <hi>Abraham</hi> told there <hi>Diues: Sonne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16.25.</note> 
                     <hi>remember that thou in thy life time receiuedſt thy pleaſures, or good things: and contrariwiſe, Lazarus paines, or euill things. Now therefore hee is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> The ſame here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour pronounceth to all thoſe which embrace the pleaſures of this preſent world: <hi>Woe to them that now laugh; for that they haue receiued their conſolation.</hi> And againe, <hi>Bleſſed are they which now weepe,</hi> and that deſpiſe the pleaſures of this world; for that their conſolation is to come. And here is plainelie portrayed out vnto vs the croſſe of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Saint <hi>Paule</hi> gloried, hunger, wéeping, reuilings, and ſuch like, to which a bleſſing is pronounced: But a wo and curſe to the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>Let all Chriſtians therfore (hearing this leſſon at their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours mouth; and ſéeing it plainly put in practiſe of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and of all the reſt of the Apoſtles: nay perceiuing the terrible execution of the tranſgreſſion thereof verified in that rich man) learne to deſpiſe this world, and all the pleaſures and delights thereof: and only to reioyce in the croſſe of Chriſt with Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and to remember that ſolemne vow they made in their Baptiſmes. Let them not buy repentance ſo deare. The money they beſtow vpon theſe vaine delightes and pleaſures, maie be far better beſtowed (with <hi>Cornelius</hi>) vpon <hi>almeſdeeds and works of mercie.</hi>

                  <p>The like we reade of <hi>Moſes;</hi> who when as he was come to age <hi>refuſed to be called the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter,</hi>

But <hi>Moſes</hi> thought that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> delightes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Gods loue and fauour could not ſtand together.

Againe, it is very ſtrange, that omitting all the other feaſts, hee will haue one onlie to remaine, that is, the feaſt of Tabernacles. Here no doubt the Prophet teacheth vs to forſake the letter: For the letter killeth. The feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles was ordained (as appeareth in <hi>Exod. 23.</hi>) that the children of Iſrael might remember their abode in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

And this feaſt though it be aboliſhed literally, yet God will haue the faithfull ſtill to obſerue it ſpiritually; that as they trauailed in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe thoſe fortie yeares: ſo we alſo in this world ſhould be as pilgrims and ſtrangers all the courſe of our life; and that we ſhould know, that we are borne here in the world, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I would to God all Chriſtians would but marke what cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the verie Heathens haue giuen concerning vſurie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as one aſked <hi>Cato Cenſorius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2. Off.</note> what were the chiefe points of good huſbandrie? He anſwered, <hi>To feed well, to cloath wel, and to till well.</hi> And to him that aſked, <hi>What is it to commit vſurie? Is not that alſo a point of good husbandrie? <hi>Cato</hi>
                     </hi> anſwered, <hi>What is it, to kill a man?</hi> He thought that an vſurer ſinned as greatly as a murtherer. Did <hi>Cato</hi> iudge thus of vſurie by the light of nature, and ſhall Chriſtians profeſſe it; or thinke better of it in the light of the Goſpell?<note place="margin">Panor. lib. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Alphonſus <hi>king of Aragon compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vſurers to greedie birds, which ſnatched &amp; catched all things.</hi>
                     </hi> And ſurely no doubt, verie iuſtlie. For vſurers are the cruelleſt Kites and vultures in the world. They conſume mens patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they often kill their bodies, and vndoe their heires. And this they do to their brethren, <hi>to whom they were bound to open, euen their verie hearts and bowels to do them good,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.17.</note> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth. And will not then, theſe cruell hearted men open to them their coffers or purſes? Another compares Vſurers to the diuell: for <hi>what els</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do Vſurers, but that which the diuell perſwaded Chriſt to haue done?

                     <hi>they gaine of ſtones and mettalles that which nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth.

And wheras lending was commanded of God to profit our brethren, now the vſurer thereby (peruerting this order of God) profits himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, that interpretation <hi>(of the two edged ſword</hi> in the Reuelation) of <hi>Victorinus</hi> an ancient Biſhop,<note place="margin">Victor. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal.</note> is worth the marking, <hi>By the two-edged ſword gliſtering out of his mouth, is meant, that it is he, that now ſhewed to the world the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpell: and by Moſes the knowledge of the lawe. But becauſe, by the ſame word hee ſhall iudge hereafter all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that were both vnder the law, and vnder the Goſpell: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid to be a two edged ſword. A ſword armes a ſouldier, kils a mans enemie, and puniſheth a reuolter or a turnecoate. And that he might ſhew his Apoſtles that he preached iudgement, he ſaith, <hi>I came not to ſend peace into the world, but a ſword.</hi> And after
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:25632:302"/> that, he had ended his parables, he ſaith vnto them: Haue you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all theſe things? And they ſaid, yea. Therefore euerie Scribe learned in the kingdome of God, is like to a houſholder bringing out of his treaſure new and old things: that is, the new words of the Goſpell, and the old of the law and Prophets. And that theſe come out of his mouth: He ſaid to Peter, Go to the ſea, and caſt in an angle, and the fiſh that thou ſhalt firſt take, opening his mouth, thou ſhalt find a ſtavre (that is two pence) giue it for me and thee. And Dauid alſo by the holy Ghoſt ſaith: God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken once: I haue heard theſe two things: That God hath once determined, that in the beginning, that ſhall continue to the end. To conclude, when as he is appointed of his Father to be Iudge, he minding to ſhew that through the word, which is preached to them, men ſhould be iudged, he ſaith, Do you thinke that I will iudge you in the laſt day? But the word which I haue ſpoken vnto you, that ſhall iudge you in the laſt day. And Paul againſt Antichriſt ſaith to the Theſſalonians:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Whom the Lord ſhall kill with the ſpirit of his mouth.

                  <p>IVſtine <hi>the Martyr thus deſcribes the ancient Chriſtians.</hi> Chriſtians differ not from other men, neither in countrey nor ſpeech,<note place="margin">Iuſt. epiſt. ad Diog.</note> nor in ciuill gouernement. They dwell in no cities by themſelues; neither vſe they anie language, that differs from the common ſpeech of other men; neither haue they a kinde of life which is famous for any ſingular or odde thing in it; neither doe they go about to learne any thing deuiſed of curious heads; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they patrons of any mans opinion, as many are: but inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting partly in the cities of the Grecians, and partly of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, as euerie mans lot hath befallen him, following the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people with whom they dwell, in their apparell, and liuing, and other things, which concerning this preſent life, they ſet before our eyes a wonderfull ſtate of their common wealth. They dwel in their owne countries, but as it were ſtrangers. They haue all things common with other men as citizens; and they diſtribute all things away, as it were ſome trauelling into another countrie. Euery ſtrange region is their countrie: And all their countries are to them, as ſtrange regions and dominions. They marie wiues as other men do, and beget children; but they make not their children away, as the heathen do. They haue a common
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:25632:303"/> table, but not polluted with exceſſe. They are in the fleſh; and yet they liue not according to the fleſh. They liue here vpon earth, but they haue their conuerſation in heauen. They obey lawes which are made; nay in their maner of liuing, they farre exceede and go beyond the lawes. They loue all men, and all men perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them. They are not knowne what they are, and yet they are condemned to death. They are murdered, and yet they are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. They are poore, &amp; yet they make many rich. They want al things, and yet they abound in all things. They are diſhonoured, and in their ignominie their glorie ſhines. They are ſlandered, and yet all men beare record of their innocency. They are reuiled, and they giue good ſpeeches againe. They are iniured, and they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their perſecutors. And when as they liue like good men, they are puniſhed as though they were wicked. And when as they are puniſhed, they reioyce; as though then they were reuiued. The Iewes make warre againſt them, as againſt ſtrangers: &amp; the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians perſecute them: &amp; they which hate them cannot tell wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hate them. And that I may in one word ſay all: That which the ſoule is in the bodie; that are Chriſtians in the world. The ſoule dwelleth in the bodie; but it is not of the body: So Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians dwell in the world, but they are none of the world. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible ſoule is placed in the viſible bodie, as in a garriſon: ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are knowne while they liue in the world; but their diuine worſhip of God is inuiſible. The fleſh hates the ſoule, and makes war againſt it; becauſe it cannot enioy her pleaſures: And the world alſo hates Chriſtians; they reſiſt their pleaſures. The ſoule loues the fleſh, which hates her, and loueth her members: So alſo Chriſtians loue them, which hate them. The ſoule is incloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bodie, but it preſerueth the body: ſo alſo Chriſtians are kept in the world, as in a priſon; but they preſerue the world. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſoule dwelleth in a mortall tabernacle: and Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite amongſt thoſe things which are corruptible, as ſtrangers looking for the immortality of heauen. The ſoule the worſe it is fed, is the better: ſo Chriſtians whiles they are daily puniſhed, are increaſed. &amp;c. <hi>By this it appeareth how zealous in the ſeruice of God, how homely and ſimple in their apparel, what contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the world Chriſtians were in the beginning. Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne by their examples the Atheiſts and lukewarme Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in religion, the curious and couetous worldlings of our

We are troubled about the cares of this life: but wee are inſtructed of the life to come. If at anie time the Prophets do make mention of the calling of the people backe againe from Babylon, of reſtoring the kingdom of Iſrael, or of the repairing of the Temple; by and by as it were forgetting themſelues, they are rapt to ſpeake of the ſpirituall deliuerance from the yoke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, of the kingdom of Chriſt, and of the deſcription of the true Temple, that is, of the Church. Hereby ſignifying vnto vs, that wee muſt not cleaue to, and reſt in theſe momentarie and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie things, which are nothing elſe, but a ſhadow; and that we ſhould not haue our kingdome here in this world: but that Chriſt ſhould raigne in vs, by the ſcepter of his word, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his ſpirit.

                     </hi> Let vs that are religious, and like to the word of God, make haſte and runne. O men! O his images! let vs make haſte, let vs runne. Let vs take his yoke vpon vs; let vs take vpon vs incorruption. Let vs loue Chriſt that moſt excellent carter and driuer (as it were) of men: hee yoked the foale and the old Aſſe vnder one yoke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and likewiſe he made two yokes of men, and he driues his chariote to immortalitie, making haſte to God; that hee might now euidently fulfill that, that myſtically before he ſignified in Ieruſalem; doing now the ſame in heauen.

Therefore the word will ſay (there is no doubt) whether of theſe be better, to bee wiſe and ſober, or to be mad? Therefore we muſt, cleauing to the truth, valiantly followe God with all our ſtrength, behauing our ſelues ſoberly, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all his things ſuch, as they are indeed.

And alſo he ſheweth vs the reaſon of it, and maner of faſting which was then vſed in the Church, and the vertue alſo thereof. So that then Lent was obſerued, thorough the whole Church.

And this was the reaſon why the firſt Chriſtians vſed it: They would follow Chriſt as neere as they could. And therefore in another place he writes thus:</hi> My brethren, it is no ſmall offence, to breake Lent, appointed of the Lord; &amp; through the greedineſſe of the belly, to diſſolue the conſecrated faſtes. Hee that ſaith that he abides in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Tom. 3. ſer. 25. de quadrageſ.</note> ought to walke as he hath wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Therefore if thou wilt be a Chriſtian, thou oughteſt to do as Chriſt did. He which had no ſinne faſted Lent; and wilt not thou which art a ſinner, faſt Lent? He I ſay had no ſinne; but faſted for our ſinnes: what kind of Chriſtian art thou in thine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that when as Chriſt faſted for thee, thou wilt dine? that whereas Chriſt faſted for thee, thou wilt haue thy meales?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Here we maie learne two things. Firſt that the Fathers grounded their faſt of Lent, vpon the example of our Sauior Chriſt:</hi> Let them ſhew any other reaſon which refuſe to faſt (<hi>ſaith</hi> Ambroſe) why Chriſt faſted fortie dayes, but for our learning, and to giue vs an example? <hi>Againe, it ſéemed to them a verie abſurd thing, that Chriſt ſhould faſt fortie daies for vs: and that wee (as néere as we could) ſhould not follow him, and faſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes for our ſelues. Secondly, that when they faſted, they dined not, but deferred their dinners till night: and that which ſhould haue béene for their dinners, they vſed to giue to the poore: As appeareth by another place, where he ſpeaks at large of the maner of their faſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt know (my brethren) that this faſt is acceptable to God, not onely that we ſhould tame our bodies through abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,<note place="margin">Tom. 3. ſer. 33.</note> but alſo that we ſhould put humilitie vpon our ſoules. Let vs be gentle to our ſeruants, curteous to ſtrangers, mercifull to the poore. Riſing verie early, let vs make haſte to go to the Church: let vs giue God thankes: let vs aske pardon for our ſinnes, crauing mercie for thoſe which are paſt, and watchfulneſſe and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a taking heed for our ſins to come. Let vs ſpend all the
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:25632:315"/> day either in prayer, or reading: he that cannot reade, let him ſeeke out ſome holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by whoſe talk he may be edified. Let no worldly works hinder the works of God. Let not playing at tables withdraw thy mind, nor the pleaſure of thy dogges abſtract thy ſenſes, nor the greedines of the gaine of any matter peruert thy ſoule. For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou ſhalt do beſide the commandement of God, although thou abſtaine, thou faſteſt not. For this is a wholſom faſt, that as thy body abſtaines from delights, ſo alſo that thy ſoul be brideled from vices. This alſo (my brethren) which is required to the perfection of faſting, is not to be paſſed ouer in ſilence, that wee which abſtaine, and doe not dine at this time, ſhould beſtow our dinners vpon the poore: for this is true righteouſneſſe, that when as thou art hungrie, another be refreſhed with thy meate: and when as thou prayeſt God with thy foreſaid faſtings, hee being filled, obtaines thy ſutes for thee: Both theſe profiting thee, both thine owne hunger, and the beggers belly being well filled. But he that faſts ſo that he imparts nothing to the poore of his good cheare, ſeems to haue made a gaine of his faſting, &amp; a good market (as we ſay) by his ſparing: for to that end he abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not that he might pleaſe God, but that he ſhould not ſpend ouer much, &amp;c. <hi>This place teacheth vs how we ought to ſpend our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting daies, in ſtudying the ſcriptures, &amp; in prayer: and that when we faſt, we ſhould not dine, but beſtow our dinners vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore. For he that breakes his faſt in the morning with bread &amp; drinke, and after at noone dines, and at night hath his bellie full of bread and drinke againe (as the moſt vſe to do when they faſt) doth this man faſt? No verily. But he faſts that eates nothing till night, if he be not hindred, through infirmitie of bodie, or ſickneſſe.

He muſt needs haue euen a wildernes of ſins, that forſakes the ſociety of the Saints (and wil not faſt with them) Faſting therefore is a wall vnto a Chriſtian, which the diuell can neuer aſſault, nor the enemie euer climbe ouer. For what Chriſtian euer faſted &amp; was taken? who euer remained ſober and was ouercome? The diuell aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:25632:316"/> the drunkard, &amp; the enemy laies ſiege to the riotous perſon: but when as he ſees one faſting, he flies away; he feares, he is afraid, he is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with his pale countenance, his hunger weakens him, &amp; his weaknes quite ouerthroweth him. He is ouerthrowne, I ſay, by his weakneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſtian weaknes is fortitude. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſaith, When I am weak,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> then I am ſtrong. But ſome wil demaund, how can infirmitie be ſtrong? Then is infirmity ſtrong, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the fleſh is leane with faſting; but the ſoule is fat with purity. For as much as you take from that the iuyce of meats, ſo much the vertue of righteouſnes is increaſed in this. Then a man is weake to worldly works, but ſtrong to the works of God: then he more ſeriouſly thinks of God, then he feares his iudgement, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his enemie.<note place="margin">Matt. 17.</note> Our Sauior ſaith of the diuel: This kind is not caſt out but by faſting &amp; prayers. He ſaith verily that he which is poſſeſſed of the diuel, cannot be purged, but by faſtings. Marke wel therefore what great force is in faſting, &amp; what great grace ſhe affordeth to the man himſelfe whom ſhe dwelleth in, which yeelds ſuch a forcible medicine to another man: how ſhe ſanctifies her owne man, which doth thus purifie another man. It is a ſtrange thing, one man faſts, &amp; another reaps the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of his faſting: Therefore (my brethren) let vs not lay aſide the weapons of our abſtinence, &amp; let vs haue a care to keep the faſtings of our 40. dayes, without any intermiſsion: for this is a perfect number to ouercom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For the Lord ouercame the diuel, after that he had faſted 40. daies; not but that he could haue ouercome him alſo before his faſting, but that he might ſhew vs, that then we are able to be conquerors of the diuel, when as we haue beene conquerors of our carnall luſts by faſting 40. dayes, &amp; that he that hath violated this holy number, through the exceſſe of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, as a weakling and a wretch he may be eaſily ouercome of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie: for how can he ouercome the malice of the diuell in another, which hath not ouercome the vnrulineſſe of gluttony in himſelfe? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (O man) be firſt a conqueror of thy ſelf, that thou maiſt be a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of another. For thou haſt thy proper enemies within thee, which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do aſſault thee. Behold couetouſneſſe with the ambition of riches vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines thee: Riot with her pleaſant banquets takes thee priſoner; and hereſie with her froward knowledge ouerthrowes thee. Ouercome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe thy proper enemies, that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> maiſt be able to ouercome other mens, &amp;c. <hi>Here we maie learne the neceſſitie of faſtings: by</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe <hi>iudgement, they are the onlie tents of Chriſtian ſouldiers; he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abideth not in them, ſhall be ſoone ſnatched vp of the enemie. And their force is ſuch, that they preuaile euen againſt the diuell himſelfe.

That holineſſe of life, which flouriſhed amongſt all ſorts of men in the Primitiue Church appeares not in our daies, becauſe we vſe not thoſe means of faſting and prayer which they vſed.

                     <hi>it ſhall no more profite vs, then it did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they were (as S.</hi> Paul <hi>there ſaith) catechized &amp; inſtructed in the law, euen as well as we are, and knew the will of God.</hi>

The people riſing in the night, go to the houſe of prayer, &amp; making a confeſſion to God, in labours and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind and continuall teares; at length riſing from prayer, they are appointed to ſing Pſalmes, and being deuided into two parts, they ſing, one part anſwering another; &amp; after that, they ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with exerciſing &amp; meditation of the word of God, &amp; they prepare to their hearts thereby attention, and (hauing reiected all vaine cares) ſoundnes &amp; conſtantneſſe. Then one of them hath this office committed to him, to begin the Pſalme, &amp; al the reſt ſing after him; and ſo they paſſe ouer the night with varietie of ſinging of Pſalmes, prayers being entermingled: at the breake of the day they altogether, as being one man, with one mouth, &amp; with one hart, offer to God a pſalme of confeſſion; and they profeſſe repentance euerie man with his own words. If you flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs for theſe things, you muſt alſo fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Egypt, you muſt alſo fly from both Libyas, from the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, Paleſtines, Arabians, Phoenicians, Syrians, &amp; they that dwell by Euphrates; &amp; that I may ſay all in one word, all thoſe with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, &amp; prayers, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſinging of Pſalmes are of great account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here is plainlie ſet downe the forme of common prayers, vſed in the Primitiue Church. They roſe to praier before daie, they made a general confeſſion, as we do, all together of their ſinnes; but with teares, which we leaue out. They read the Scriptures, &amp; with them ſtrengthened their faith. They ſang Pſalmes all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes, and other ſomtimes prayed. Thus they ſpent their nights: and this was the common practiſe of all the Churches in thoſe daies: but now we cannot abide either to wéepe, or to watch in prayer. Let vs follow their holie footſteps, which agree with the Scriptures, as before hath béene declared.</hi>
